{"package_name": "javax.sql", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": " An object that registers to be notified of events generated by a\n PooledConnection object. The ConnectionEventListener interface is implemented by a\n connection pooling component.  A connection pooling component will\n usually be provided by a JDBC driver vendor or another system software\n vendor.  A JDBC driver notifies a ConnectionEventListener\n object when an application is finished using a pooled connection with\n which the listener has registered.  The notification\n occurs after the application calls the method close on\n its representation of a PooledConnection object.  A\n ConnectionEventListener is also notified when a\n connection error occurs due to the fact that the PooledConnection\n is unfit for future use---the server has crashed, for example.\n The listener is notified by the JDBC driver just before the driver throws an\n SQLException to the application using the\n PooledConnection object.
