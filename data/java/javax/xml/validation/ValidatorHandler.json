{"package_name": "javax.xml.validation", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Streaming validator that works on SAX stream. A ValidatorHandler object is a thread-unsafe, non-reentrant object.\n In other words, it is the application's responsibility to make\n sure that one ValidatorHandler object is not used from\n more than one thread at any given time. ValidatorHandler checks if the SAX events follow\n the set of constraints described in the associated Schema,\n and additionally it may modify the SAX events (for example\n by adding default values, etc.) ValidatorHandler extends from ContentHandler,\n but it refines the underlying ContentHandler in\n the following way: A ValidatorHandler is automatically reset every time\n the startDocument method is invoked.
