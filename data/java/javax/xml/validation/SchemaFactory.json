It reads external\n representations of schemas and prepares them for validation. The SchemaFactory class is not thread-safe. In other words,\n it is the application's responsibility to ensure that at most\n one thread is using a SchemaFactory object at any\n given moment. Implementations are encouraged to mark methods\n as synchronized to protect themselves from broken clients. SchemaFactory is not re-entrant. While one of the\n newSchema methods is being invoked, applications\n may not attempt to recursively invoke the newSchema method,\n even from the same thread.
