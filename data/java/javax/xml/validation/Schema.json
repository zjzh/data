{"package_name": "javax.xml.validation", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Immutable in-memory representation of grammar. This object represents a set of constraints that can be checked/\n enforced against an XML document. A Schema object is thread safe and applications are\n encouraged to share it across many parsers in many threads. A Schema object is immutable in the sense that it shouldn't\n change the set of constraints once it is created. In other words,\n if an application validates the same document twice against the same\n Schema, it must always produce the same result. A Schema object is usually created from SchemaFactory. Two kinds of validators can be created from a Schema object.\n One is Validator, which provides highly-level validation\n operations that cover typical use cases. The other is\n ValidatorHandler, which works on top of SAX for better\n modularity. This specification does not refine\n the Object.equals(java.lang.Object) method.\n In other words, if you parse the same schema twice, you may\n still get !schemaA.equals(schemaB).
