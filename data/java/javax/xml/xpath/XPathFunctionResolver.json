{"package_name": "javax.xml.xpath", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": " XPathFunctionResolver provides access to the set of user defined XPathFunctions. XPath functions are resolved by name and arity.\n The resolver is not needed for XPath built-in functions and the resolver\n cannot be used to override those functions. In particular, the resolver is only called for functions in an another\n namespace (functions with an explicit prefix). This means that you cannot\n use the XPathFunctionResolver to implement specifications\n like XML-Signature Syntax\n and Processing which extend the function library of XPath 1.0 in the\n same namespace. This is a consequence of the design of the resolver. If you wish to implement additional built-in functions, you will have to\n extend the underlying implementation directly.
