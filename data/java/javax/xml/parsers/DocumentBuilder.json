{"package_name": "javax.xml.parsers", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Defines the API to obtain DOM Document instances from an XML\n document. Using this class, an application programmer can obtain a\n Document from XML. An instance of this class can be obtained from the\n DocumentBuilderFactory#newDocumentBuilder() method. Once\n an instance of this class is obtained, XML can be parsed from a\n variety of input sources. These input sources are InputStreams,\n Files, URLs, and SAX InputSources. Note that this class reuses several classes from the SAX API. This\n does not require that the implementor of the underlying DOM\n implementation use a SAX parser to parse XML document into a\n Document. It merely requires that the implementation\n communicate with the application using these existing APIs.
