{"package_name": "javax.xml.parsers", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Defines the API that wraps an XMLReader\n implementation class. In JAXP 1.0, this class wrapped the\n Parser interface, however this interface was\n replaced by the XMLReader. For ease\n of transition, this class continues to support the same name\n and interface as well as supporting new methods.\n\n An instance of this class can be obtained from the\n SAXParserFactory.newSAXParser() method.\n Once an instance of this class is obtained, XML can be parsed from\n a variety of input sources. These input sources are InputStreams,\n Files, URLs, and SAX InputSources. This static method creates a new factory instance based\n on a system property setting or uses the platform default\n if no property has been defined. The system property that controls which Factory implementation\n to create is named \"javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory\".\n This property names a class that is a concrete subclass of this\n abstract class. If no property is defined, a platform default\n will be used. Implementations of this class which wrap an underlying implementation\n can consider using the ParserAdapter\n class to initially adapt their SAX1 implementation to work under\n this revised class.
