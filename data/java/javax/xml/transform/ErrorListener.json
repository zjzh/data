{"package_name": "javax.xml.transform", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": " To provide customized error handling, implement this interface and\n use the setErrorListener method to register an instance of the\n implementation with the Transformer.  The\n Transformer then reports all errors and warnings through this\n interface. If an application does not register its own custom\n ErrorListener, the default ErrorListener\n is used which reports all warnings and errors to System.err\n and does not throw any Exceptions.\n Applications are strongly encouraged to register and use\n ErrorListeners that insure proper behavior for warnings and\n errors. For transformation errors, a Transformer must use this\n interface instead of throwing an Exception: it is up to the\n application to decide whether to throw an Exception for\n different types of errors and warnings.  Note however that the\n Transformer is not required to continue with the transformation\n after a call to fatalError(javax.xml.transform.TransformerException). Transformers may use this mechanism to report XML parsing\n errors as well as transformation errors.
