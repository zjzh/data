It may be subclassed by other\n factories, which create particular types of server sockets.  This\n provides a general framework for the addition of public socket-level\n functionality.  It is the server side analogue of a socket factory,\n and similarly provides a way to capture a variety of policies related\n to the sockets being constructed. Like socket factories, server Socket factory instances have\n methods used to create sockets. There is also an environment\n specific default server socket factory; frameworks will often use\n their own customized factory.
