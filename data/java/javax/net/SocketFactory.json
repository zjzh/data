{"package_name": "javax.net", "subclass_list": ["SSLSocketFactory", "SSLSocketFactory"], "class_description": "This class creates sockets.  It may be subclassed by other factories,\n which create particular subclasses of sockets and thus provide a general\n framework for the addition of public socket-level functionality. Socket factories are a simple way to capture a variety of policies\n related to the sockets being constructed, producing such sockets in\n a way which does not require special configuration of the code which\n asks for the sockets: Factory classes are specified by environment-specific configuration\n mechanisms.  For example, the getDefault method could return\n a factory that was appropriate for a particular user or applet, and a\n framework could use a factory customized to its own purposes.
