{"package_name": "javax.net.ssl", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Instances of this class represent a matcher that performs match\n operations on an SNIServerName instance. Servers can use Server Name Indication (SNI) information to decide if\n specific SSLSocket or SSLEngine instances should accept\n a connection.  For example, when multiple \"virtual\" or \"name-based\"\n servers are hosted on a single underlying network address, the server\n application can use SNI information to determine whether this server is\n the exact server that the client wants to access.  Instances of this\n class can be used by a server to verify the acceptable server names of\n a particular type, such as host names. SNIMatcher objects are immutable.  Subclasses should not provide\n methods that can change the state of an instance once it has been created.
