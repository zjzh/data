A SSLEngine provides a means for establishing\n secure communication sessions between two peers.  SSLEngine\n operations typically consume bytes from an input buffer and produce\n bytes in an output buffer.  This class provides operational result\n values describing the state of the SSLEngine, including\n indications of what operations are needed to finish an\n ongoing handshake.  Lastly, it reports the number of bytes consumed\n and produced as a result of this operation.
