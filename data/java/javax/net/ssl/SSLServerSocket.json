{"package_name": "javax.net.ssl", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class extends ServerSockets and\n provides secure server sockets using protocols such as the Secure\n Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. Instances of this class are generally created using a\n SSLServerSocketFactory.  The primary function\n of SSLServerSockets\n is to create SSLSockets by accepting\n connections. SSLServerSockets contain several pieces of state data\n which are inherited by the SSLSocket at\n socket creation.  These include the enabled cipher\n suites and protocols, whether client\n authentication is necessary, and whether created sockets should\n begin handshaking in client or server mode.  The state\n inherited by the created SSLSocket can be\n overriden by calling the appropriate methods.
