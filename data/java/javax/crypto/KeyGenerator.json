{"package_name": "javax.crypto", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class provides the functionality of a secret (symmetric) key generator. Key generators are constructed using one of the getInstance\n class methods of this class. KeyGenerator objects are reusable, i.e., after a key has been\n generated, the same KeyGenerator object can be re-used to generate further\n keys. There are two ways to generate a key: in an algorithm-independent\n manner, and in an algorithm-specific manner.\n The only difference between the two is the initialization of the object: In case the client does not explicitly initialize the KeyGenerator\n (via a call to an init method), each provider must\n supply (and document) a default initialization. Android provides the following KeyGenerator algorithms: ", "class_type": "class", "typealias": [], "interface_list": [""], "class_inherit_list": ["Object"], "Methods": [], "class_name": "KeyGenerator", "Vars": null}
