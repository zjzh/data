{"package_name": "javax.crypto", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class provides the functionality of a key agreement (or key\n exchange) protocol. The keys involved in establishing a shared secret are created by one of the\n key generators (KeyPairGenerator or\n KeyGenerator), a KeyFactory, or as a result from\n an intermediate phase of the key agreement protocol. For each of the correspondents in the key exchange, doPhase\n needs to be called. For example, if this key exchange is with one other\n party, doPhase needs to be called once, with the\n lastPhase flag set to true.\n If this key exchange is\n with two other parties, doPhase needs to be called twice,\n the first time setting the lastPhase flag to\n false, and the second time setting it to true.\n There may be any number of parties involved in a key exchange.
