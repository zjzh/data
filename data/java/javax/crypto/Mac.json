{"package_name": "javax.crypto", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class provides the functionality of a \"Message Authentication Code\"\n (MAC) algorithm. A MAC provides a way to check\n the integrity of information transmitted over or stored in an unreliable\n medium, based on a secret key. Typically, message\n authentication codes are used between two parties that share a secret\n key in order to validate information transmitted between these\n parties. A MAC mechanism that is based on cryptographic hash functions is\n referred to as HMAC. HMAC can be used with any cryptographic hash function,\n e.g., MD5 or SHA-1, in combination with a secret shared key. HMAC is\n specified in RFC 2104.
