{"package_name": "javax.crypto", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A CipherOutputStream is composed of an OutputStream and a Cipher so\n that write() methods first process the data before writing them out\n to the underlying OutputStream.  The cipher must be fully\n initialized before being used by a CipherOutputStream. For example, if the cipher is initialized for encryption, the\n CipherOutputStream will attempt to encrypt data before writing out the\n encrypted data. This class adheres strictly to the semantics, especially the\n failure semantics, of its ancestor classes\n java.io.OutputStream and java.io.FilterOutputStream.  This class\n has exactly those methods specified in its ancestor classes, and\n overrides them all.  Moreover, this class catches all exceptions\n that are not thrown by its ancestor classes. It is crucial for a programmer using this class not to use\n methods that are not defined or overriden in this class (such as a\n new method or constructor that is later added to one of the super\n classes), because the design and implementation of those methods\n are unlikely to have considered security impact with regard to\n CipherOutputStream.
