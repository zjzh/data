{"package_name": "javax.security.auth.callback", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": " An application implements a CallbackHandler and passes\n it to underlying security services so that they may interact with\n the application to retrieve specific authentication data,\n such as usernames and passwords, or to display certain information,\n such as error and warning messages. CallbackHandlers are implemented in an application-dependent fashion.\n For example, implementations for an application with a graphical user\n interface (GUI) may pop up windows to prompt for requested information\n or to display error messages.  An implementation may also choose to obtain\n requested information from an alternate source without asking the end user. Underlying security services make requests for different types\n of information by passing individual Callbacks to the\n CallbackHandler.  The CallbackHandler\n implementation decides how to retrieve and display information\n depending on the Callbacks passed to it.  For example,\n if the underlying service needs a username and password to\n authenticate a user, it uses a NameCallback and\n PasswordCallback.  The CallbackHandler\n can then choose to prompt for a username and password serially,\n or to prompt for both in a single window. A default CallbackHandler class implementation\n may be specified by setting the value of the\n auth.login.defaultCallbackHandler security property. If the security property is set to the fully qualified name of a\n CallbackHandler implementation class,\n then a LoginContext will load the specified\n CallbackHandler and pass it to the underlying LoginModules.\n The LoginContext only loads the default handler\n if it was not provided one. All default handler implementations must provide a public\n zero-argument constructor.
