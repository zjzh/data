A ListIterator\n has no current element; its cursor position always\n lies between the element that would be returned by a call\n to previous() and the element that would be\n returned by a call to next().\n An iterator for a list of length n has n+1 possible\n cursor positions, as illustrated by the carets (^) below: This interface is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework.
