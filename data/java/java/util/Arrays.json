{"package_name": "java.util", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class contains various methods for manipulating arrays (such as\n sorting and searching). This class also contains a static factory\n that allows arrays to be viewed as lists. The methods in this class all throw a NullPointerException,\n if the specified array reference is null, except where noted. The documentation for the methods contained in this class includes\n briefs description of the implementations. Such descriptions should\n be regarded as implementation notes, rather than parts of the\n specification. Implementors should feel free to substitute other\n algorithms, so long as the specification itself is adhered to. (For\n example, the algorithm used by sort(Object[]) does not have to be\n a MergeSort, but it does have to be stable.) This class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework.
