The Map.entrySet method returns\n a collection-view of the map, whose elements are of this class.  The\n only way to obtain a reference to a map entry is from the\n iterator of this collection-view.  These Map.Entry objects are\n valid only for the duration of the iteration; more formally,\n the behavior of a map entry is undefined if the backing map has been\n modified after the entry was returned by the iterator, except through\n the setValue operation on the map entry.
