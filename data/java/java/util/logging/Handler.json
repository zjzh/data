{"package_name": "java.util.logging", "subclass_list": ["MemoryHandler", "StreamHandler", "MemoryHandler", "StreamHandler"], "class_description": "A Handler object takes log messages from a Logger and\n exports them.  It might for example, write them to a console\n or write them to a file, or send them to a network logging service,\n or forward them to an OS log, or whatever. A Handler can be disabled by doing a setLevel(Level.OFF)\n and can  be re-enabled by doing a setLevel with an appropriate level. Handler classes typically use LogManager properties to set\n default values for the Handler's Filter, Formatter,\n and Level.  See the specific documentation for each concrete\n Handler class.
