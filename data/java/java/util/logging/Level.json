The logging Level objects\n are ordered and are specified by ordered integers.  Enabling logging\n at a given level also enables logging at all higher levels. Clients should normally use the predefined Level constants such\n as Level.SEVERE. The levels in descending order are: It is possible for third parties to define additional logging\n levels by subclassing Level.  In such cases subclasses should\n take care to chose unique integer level values and to ensure that\n they maintain the Object uniqueness property across serialization\n by defining a suitable readResolve method.
