{"package_name": "java.util", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "An unbounded priority Queue based on a priority heap.\n The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their\n Comparable, or by a Comparator\n provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is\n used.  A priority queue does not permit null elements.\n A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit\n insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in\n ClassCastException). The head of this queue is the least element\n with respect to the specified ordering.  If multiple elements are\n tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are\n broken arbitrarily.  The queue retrieval operations poll,\n remove, peek, and element access the\n element at the head of the queue. A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal\n capacity governing the size of an array used to store the\n elements on the queue.  It is always at least as large as the queue\n size.  As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity\n grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not\n specified. This class and its iterator implement all of the\n optional methods of the Collection and Iterator interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method iterator() is not guaranteed to traverse the elements of\n the priority queue in any particular order. If you need ordered\n traversal, consider using Arrays.sort(pq.toArray()). Note that this implementation is not synchronized.\n Multiple threads should not access a PriorityQueue\n instance concurrently if any of the threads modifies the queue.\n Instead, use the thread-safe PriorityBlockingQueue class. Implementation note: this implementation provides\n O(log(n)) time for the enqueuing and dequeuing methods\n (offer, poll, remove() and add);\n linear time for the remove(Object) and contains(Object)\n methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods\n (peek, element, and size). This class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework.
