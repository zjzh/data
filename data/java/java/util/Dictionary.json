{"package_name": "java.util", "subclass_list": ["Hashtable", "Hashtable"], "class_description": "The Dictionary class is the abstract parent of any\n class, such as Hashtable, which maps keys to values.\n Every key and every value is an object. In any one Dictionary\n object, every key is associated with at most one value. Given a\n Dictionary and a key, the associated element can be looked up.\n Any non-null object can be used as a key and as a value. As a rule, the equals method should be used by\n implementations of this class to decide if two keys are the same. NOTE: This class is obsolete.  New implementations should\n implement the Map interface, rather than extending this class.
