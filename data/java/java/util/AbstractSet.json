The process of implementing a set by extending this class is identical\n to that of implementing a Collection by extending AbstractCollection,\n except that all of the methods and constructors in subclasses of this\n class must obey the additional constraints imposed by the Set\n interface (for instance, the add method must not permit addition of\n multiple instances of an object to a set). Note that this class does not override any of the implementations from\n the AbstractCollection class.  It merely adds implementations\n for equals and hashCode. This class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework.
