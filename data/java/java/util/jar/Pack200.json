Here is an example using  packer and unpacker: A Pack200 file compressed with gzip can be hosted on HTTP/1.1 web servers.\n The deployment applications can use \"Accept-Encoding=pack200-gzip\". This\n indicates to the server that the client application desires a version of\n the file encoded with Pack200 and further compressed with gzip. Please\n refer to  Java Deployment Guide for more details and\n techniques. Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or\n method in this class will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.
