{"package_name": "java.time", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A month-of-year, such as 'July'. Month is an enum representing the 12 months of the year -\n January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,\n November and December. In addition to the textual enum name, each month-of-year has an int value.\n The int value follows normal usage and the ISO-8601 standard,\n from 1 (January) to 12 (December). It is recommended that applications use the enum\n rather than the int value to ensure code clarity. Do not use ordinal() to obtain the numeric representation of Month.\n Use getValue() instead. This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.\n As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the month-of-year\n concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO-8601 calendar system.
