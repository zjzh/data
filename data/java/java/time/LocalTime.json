{"package_name": "java.time", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,\n such as 10:15:30. LocalTime is an immutable date-time object that represents a time,\n often viewed as hour-minute-second.\n Time is represented to nanosecond precision.\n For example, the value \"13:45.30.123456789\" can be stored in a LocalTime. This class does not store or represent a date or time-zone.\n Instead, it is a description of the local time as seen on a wall clock.\n It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information\n such as an offset or time-zone. The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today\n in most of the world. This API assumes that all calendar systems use the same\n representation, this class, for time-of-day.
