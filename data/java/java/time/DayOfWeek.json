{"package_name": "java.time", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A day-of-week, such as 'Tuesday'. DayOfWeek is an enum representing the 7 days of the week -\n Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. In addition to the textual enum name, each day-of-week has an int value.\n The int value follows the ISO-8601 standard, from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).\n It is recommended that applications use the enum rather than the int value\n to ensure code clarity. This enum provides access to the localized textual form of the day-of-week.\n Some locales also assign different numeric values to the days, declaring\n Sunday to have the value 1, however this class provides no support for this.\n See WeekFields for localized week-numbering. Do not use ordinal() to obtain the numeric representation of DayOfWeek.\n Use getValue() instead. This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.\n As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the day-of-week\n concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO calendar system.
