{"package_name": "java.time.chrono", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "The Hijrah calendar is a lunar calendar supporting Islamic calendars. The HijrahChronology follows the rules of the Hijrah calendar system. The Hijrah\n calendar has several variants based on differences in when the new moon is\n determined to have occurred and where the observation is made.\n In some variants the length of each month is\n computed algorithmically from the astronomical data for the moon and earth and\n in others the length of the month is determined by an authorized sighting\n of the new moon. For the algorithmically based calendars the calendar\n can project into the future.\n For sighting based calendars only historical data from past\n sightings is available. The length of each month is 29 or 30 days.\n Ordinary years have 354 days; leap years have 355 days. CLDR and LDML identify variants: Additional variants may be available through Chronology#getAvailableChronologies(). Example Selecting the chronology from the locale uses Chronology#ofLocale\n to find the Chronology based on Locale supported BCP 47 extension mechanism\n to request a specific calendar (\"ca\").
