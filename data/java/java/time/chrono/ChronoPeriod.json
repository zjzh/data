This interface models a date-based amount of time in a calendar system.\n While most calendar systems use years, months and days, some do not.\n Therefore, this interface operates solely in terms of a set of supported\n units that are defined by the Chronology.\n The set of supported units is fixed for a given chronology.\n The amount of a supported unit may be set to zero. The period is modeled as a directed amount of time, meaning that individual\n parts of the period may be negative.
