{"package_name": "java.time.chrono", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A date in the Hijrah calendar system. This date operates using one of several variants of the\n HijrahChronology. The Hijrah calendar has a different total of days in a year than\n Gregorian calendar, and the length of each month is based on the period\n of a complete revolution of the moon around the earth\n (as between successive new moons).\n Refer to the HijrahChronology for details of supported variants. Each HijrahDate is created bound to a particular HijrahChronology,\n The same chronology is propagated to each HijrahDate computed from the date.\n To use a different Hijrah variant, its HijrahChronology can be used\n to create new HijrahDate instances.\n Alternatively, the withVariant(HijrahChronology) method can be used to convert\n to a new HijrahChronology.
