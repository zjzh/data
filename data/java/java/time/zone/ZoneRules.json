{"package_name": "java.time.zone", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "The rules defining how the zone offset varies for a single time-zone. The rules model all the historic and future transitions for a time-zone.\n ZoneOffsetTransition is used for known transitions, typically historic.\n ZoneOffsetTransitionRule is used for future transitions that are based\n on the result of an algorithm. The same rules may be shared internally between multiple zone IDs. Serializing an instance of ZoneRules will store the entire set of rules.\n It does not store the zone ID as it is not part of the state of this object. A rule implementation may or may not store full information about historic\n and future transitions, and the information stored is only as accurate as\n that supplied to the implementation by the rules provider.\n Applications should treat the data provided as representing the best information\n available to the implementation of this rule.
