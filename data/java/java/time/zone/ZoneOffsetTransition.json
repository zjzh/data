{"package_name": "java.time.zone", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A transition between two offsets caused by a discontinuity in the local time-line. A transition between two offsets is normally the result of a daylight savings cutover.\n The discontinuity is normally a gap in spring and an overlap in autumn.\n ZoneOffsetTransition models the transition between the two offsets. Gaps occur where there are local date-times that simply do not exist.\n An example would be when the offset changes from +03:00 to +04:00.\n This might be described as 'the clocks will move forward one hour tonight at 1am'. Overlaps occur where there are local date-times that exist twice.\n An example would be when the offset changes from +04:00 to +03:00.\n This might be described as 'the clocks will move back one hour tonight at 2am'.
