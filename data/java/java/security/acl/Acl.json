{"package_name": "java.security.acl", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Interface representing an Access Control List (ACL).  An Access\n Control List is a data structure used to guard access to\n resources. An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL\n entries.  Each ACL entry, of interface type AclEntry, contains a\n set of permissions associated with a particular principal. (A\n principal represents an entity such as an individual user or a\n group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified as being either\n positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are to be\n granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions\n are to be denied. The ACL Entries in each ACL observe the following rules: The java.security.acl.Acl  interface extends the\n java.security.acl.Owner  interface. The Owner\n interface is used to maintain a list of owners for each ACL.  Only\n owners are allowed to modify an ACL. For example, only an owner can\n call the ACL's addEntry method to add a new ACL entry\n to the ACL.
