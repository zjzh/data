{"package_name": "java.security.acl", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This is the interface used for representing one entry in an Access\n Control List (ACL). An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL entry\n objects. Each ACL entry object contains a set of permissions associated\n with a particular principal. (A principal represents an entity such as\n an individual user or a group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified\n as being either positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are\n to be granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions\n are to be denied. Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry\n and one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL\n entries are not allowed for any principal.\n\n Note: ACL entries are by default positive. An entry becomes a\n negative entry only if the\n setNegativePermissions\n method is called on it.
