{"package_name": "java.security.cert", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI)\n for the CertificateFactory class.\n All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each\n cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation\n of a certificate factory for a particular certificate type, e.g., X.509. Certificate factories are used to generate certificate, certification path\n (CertPath) and certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from\n their encodings. A certificate factory for X.509 must return certificates that are an\n instance of java.security.cert.X509Certificate, and CRLs\n that are an instance of java.security.cert.X509CRL.
