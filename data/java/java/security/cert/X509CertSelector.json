{"package_name": "java.security.cert", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A CertSelector that selects X509Certificates that\n match all specified criteria. This class is particularly useful when\n selecting certificates from a CertStore to build a\n PKIX-compliant certification path. When first constructed, an X509CertSelector has no criteria\n enabled and each of the get methods return a default value\n (null, or -1 for the getBasicConstraints method). Therefore, the match\n method would return true for any X509Certificate.\n Typically, several criteria are enabled (by calling\n setIssuer or\n setKeyUsage, for instance) and then the\n X509CertSelector is passed to\n CertStore#getCertificates or some similar\n method. Several criteria can be enabled (by calling setIssuer\n and setSerialNumber,\n for example) such that the match method\n usually uniquely matches a single X509Certificate. We say\n usually, since it is possible for two issuing CAs to have the same\n distinguished name and each issue a certificate with the same serial\n number. Other unique combinations include the issuer, subject,\n subjectKeyIdentifier and/or the subjectPublicKey criteria. Please refer to RFC 3280:\n Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile for\n definitions of the X.509 certificate extensions mentioned below. Concurrent Access Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not\n thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single\n object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and\n provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating\n separate objects need not synchronize.
