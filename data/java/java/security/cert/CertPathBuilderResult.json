At a minimum, a CertPathBuilderResult contains the\n CertPath built by the CertPathBuilder instance.\n Implementations of this interface may add methods to return implementation\n or algorithm specific information, such as debugging information or\n certification path validation results. Concurrent Access Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this interface are not\n thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single\n object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and\n provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating\n separate objects need not synchronize.
