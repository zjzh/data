{"package_name": "java.security.cert", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class represents the successful result of the PKIX certification\n path builder algorithm. All certification paths that are built and\n returned using this algorithm are also validated according to the PKIX\n certification path validation algorithm. Instances of PKIXCertPathBuilderResult are returned by\n the build method of CertPathBuilder\n objects implementing the PKIX algorithm. All PKIXCertPathBuilderResult objects contain the\n certification path constructed by the build algorithm, the\n valid policy tree and subject public key resulting from the build\n algorithm, and a TrustAnchor describing the certification\n authority (CA) that served as a trust anchor for the certification path. Concurrent Access Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not\n thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single\n object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and\n provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating\n separate objects need not synchronize.
