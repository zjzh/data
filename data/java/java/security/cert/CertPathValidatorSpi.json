{"package_name": "java.security.cert", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "The Service Provider Interface (SPI)\n for the CertPathValidator class. All\n CertPathValidator implementations must include a class (the\n SPI class) that extends this class (CertPathValidatorSpi)\n and implements all of its methods. In general, instances of this class\n should only be accessed through the CertPathValidator class.\n For details, see the Java Cryptography Architecture. Concurrent Access Instances of this class need not be protected against concurrent\n access from multiple threads. Threads that need to access a single\n CertPathValidatorSpi instance concurrently should synchronize\n amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking before calling the\n wrapping CertPathValidator object. However, implementations of CertPathValidatorSpi may still\n encounter concurrency issues, since multiple threads each\n manipulating a different CertPathValidatorSpi instance need not\n synchronize.
