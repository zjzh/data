{"package_name": "java.security.cert", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Parameters used as input for the PKIX CertPathBuilder\n algorithm. A PKIX CertPathBuilder uses these parameters to CertPathBuilder#build a CertPath which has been\n validated according to the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. To instantiate a PKIXBuilderParameters object, an\n application must specify one or more most-trusted CAs as defined by\n the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The most-trusted CA\n can be specified using one of two constructors. An application\n can call PKIXBuilderParameters(Set, CertSelector), specifying a\n Set of TrustAnchor objects, each of which\n identifies a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call\n PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, CertSelector), specifying a\n KeyStore instance containing trusted certificate entries, each\n of which will be considered as a most-trusted CA. In addition, an application must specify constraints on the target\n certificate that the CertPathBuilder will attempt\n to build a path to. The constraints are specified as a\n CertSelector object. These constraints should provide the\n CertPathBuilder with enough search criteria to find the target\n certificate. Minimal criteria for an X509Certificate usually\n include the subject name and/or one or more subject alternative names.\n If enough criteria is not specified, the CertPathBuilder\n may throw a CertPathBuilderException. Concurrent Access Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not\n thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single\n object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and\n provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating\n separate objects need not synchronize.
