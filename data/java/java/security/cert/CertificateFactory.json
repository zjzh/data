{"package_name": "java.security.cert", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class defines the functionality of a certificate factory, which is\n used to generate certificate, certification path (CertPath)\n and certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from their encodings. For encodings consisting of multiple certificates, use\n generateCertificates when you want to\n parse a collection of possibly unrelated certificates. Otherwise,\n use generateCertPath when you want to generate\n a CertPath (a certificate chain) and subsequently\n validate it with a CertPathValidator. A certificate factory for X.509 must return certificates that are an\n instance of java.security.cert.X509Certificate, and CRLs\n that are an instance of java.security.cert.X509CRL. The following example reads a file with Base64 encoded certificates,\n which are each bounded at the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and\n bounded at the end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----. We convert the\n FileInputStream (which does not support mark\n and reset) to a BufferedInputStream (which\n supports those methods), so that each call to\n generateCertificate consumes only one certificate, and the\n read position of the input stream is positioned to the next certificate in\n the file: The following example parses a PKCS#7-formatted certificate reply stored\n in a file and extracts all the certificates from it: Android provides the following CertificateFactory types: ", "class_type": "class", "typealias": [], "interface_list": [""], "class_inherit_list": ["Object"], "Methods": [], "class_name": "CertificateFactory", "Vars": null}
