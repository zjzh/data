{"package_name": "java.security.interfaces", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "An interface to an object capable of generating DSA key pairs. The initialize methods may each be called any number\n of times. If no initialize method is called on a\n DSAKeyPairGenerator, the default is to generate 1024-bit keys, using\n precomputed p, q and g parameters and an instance of SecureRandom as\n the random bit source. Users wishing to indicate DSA-specific parameters, and to generate a key\n pair suitable for use with the DSA algorithm typically Note: it is not always necessary to do do algorithm-specific\n initialization for a DSA key pair generator. That is, it is not always\n necessary to call an initialize method in this interface.\n Algorithm-independent initialization using the initialize method\n in the KeyPairGenerator\n interface is all that is needed when you accept defaults for algorithm-specific\n parameters. Note: Some earlier implementations of this interface may not support\n larger sizes of DSA parameters such as 2048 and 3072-bit.
