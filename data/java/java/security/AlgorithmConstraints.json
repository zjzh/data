AlgorithmConstraints objects are immutable.  An implementation\n of this interface should not provide methods that can change the state\n of an instance once it has been created. Note that AlgorithmConstraints can be used to represent the\n restrictions described by the security properties\n jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms and\n jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms, or could be used by a\n concrete PKIXCertPathChecker to check whether a specified\n certificate in the certification path contains the required algorithm\n constraints.
