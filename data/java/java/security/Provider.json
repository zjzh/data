{"package_name": "java.security", "subclass_list": ["AuthProvider", "AuthProvider"], "class_description": "This class represents a \"provider\" for the\n Java Security API, where a provider implements some or all parts of\n Java Security. Services that a provider may implement include: Each provider has a name and a version number, and is configured\n in each runtime it is installed in. See The Provider Class\n in the \"Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference\"\n for information about how a particular type of provider, the\n cryptographic service provider, works and is installed. However,\n please note that a provider can be used to implement any security\n service in Java that uses a pluggable architecture with a choice\n of implementations that fit underneath. Some provider implementations may encounter unrecoverable internal\n errors during their operation, for example a failure to communicate with a\n security token. A ProviderException should be used to indicate\n such errors. The service type Provider is reserved for use by the\n security framework. Services of this type cannot be added, removed,\n or modified by applications.\n The following attributes are automatically placed in each Provider object: ", "class_type": "class", "typealias": [], "interface_list": [""], "class_inherit_list": ["Properties"], "Methods": [], "class_name": "Provider", "Vars": null}
