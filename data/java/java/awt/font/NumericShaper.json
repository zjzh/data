{"package_name": "java.awt.font", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "The NumericShaper class is used to convert Latin-1 (European)\n digits to other Unicode decimal digits.  Users of this class will\n primarily be people who wish to present data using\n national digit shapes, but find it more convenient to represent the\n data internally using Latin-1 (European) digits.  This does not\n interpret the deprecated numeric shape selector character (U+206E). Instances of NumericShaper are typically applied\n as attributes to text with the\n TextAttribute#NUMERIC_SHAPING attribute\n of the TextAttribute class.\n For example, this code snippet causes a TextLayout to\n shape European digits to Arabic in an Arabic context: Bit mask- and enum-based Unicode ranges This class supports two different programming interfaces to\n represent Unicode ranges for script-specific digits: bit\n mask-based ones, such as NumericShaper.ARABIC, and\n enum-based ones, such as NumericShaper.Range#ARABIC.\n Multiple ranges can be specified by ORing bit mask-based constants,\n such as: If the two interfaces are mixed (including serialization),\n Unicode range values are mapped to their counterparts where such\n mapping is possible, such as NumericShaper.Range.ARABIC\n from/to NumericShaper.ARABIC.  If any unmappable range\n values are specified, such as NumericShaper.Range.BALINESE,\n those ranges are ignored. Decimal Digits Precedence A Unicode range may have more than one set of decimal digits. If\n multiple decimal digits sets are specified for the same Unicode\n range, one of the sets will take precedence as follows.
