{"package_name": "java.text", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "The CollationElementIterator class is used as an iterator\n to walk through each character of an international string. Use the iterator\n to return the ordering priority of the positioned character. The ordering\n priority of a character, which we refer to as a key, defines how a character\n is collated in the given collation object. For example, consider the following in Spanish: Example of the iterator usage, CollationElementIterator.next returns the collation order\n of the next character. A collation order consists of primary order,\n secondary order and tertiary order. The data type of the collation\n order is int. The first 16 bits of a collation order\n is its primary order; the next 8 bits is the secondary order and the\n last 8 bits is the tertiary order. Note: CollationElementIterator is a part of\n RuleBasedCollator implementation. It is only usable\n with RuleBasedCollator instances.
