{"package_name": "java.io", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "The StreamTokenizer class takes an input stream and\n parses it into \"tokens\", allowing the tokens to be\n read one at a time. The parsing process is controlled by a table\n and a number of flags that can be set to various states. The\n stream tokenizer can recognize identifiers, numbers, quoted\n strings, and various comment styles. Each byte read from the input stream is regarded as a character\n in the range '\\u0000' through '\\u00FF'.\n The character value is used to look up five possible attributes of\n the character: white space, alphabetic,\n numeric, string quote, and comment character.\n Each character can have zero or more of these attributes. In addition, an instance has four flags. These flags indicate: A typical application first constructs an instance of this class,\n sets up the syntax tables, and then repeatedly loops calling the\n nextToken method in each iteration of the loop until\n it returns the value TT_EOF.
