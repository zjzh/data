{"package_name": "java.lang", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "An instance of ThreadDeath is thrown in the victim thread\n when the (deprecated) Thread#stop() method is invoked.

If\n ThreadDeath is caught by a method, it is important that it\n be rethrown so that the thread actually dies. The ThreadGroup#uncaughtException does not print out a message if ThreadDeath is\n never caught. The class ThreadDeath is specifically a subclass of\n Error rather than Exception, even though it is a\n \"normal occurrence\", because many applications catch all\n occurrences of Exception and then discard the exception.
