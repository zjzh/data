{"package_name": "java.lang", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class extends ThreadLocal to provide inheritance of values\n from parent thread to child thread: when a child thread is created, the\n child receives initial values for all inheritable thread-local variables\n for which the parent has values.  Normally the child's values will be\n identical to the parent's; however, the child's value can be made an\n arbitrary function of the parent's by overriding the childValue\n method in this class. Inheritable thread-local variables are used in preference to\n ordinary thread-local variables when the per-thread-attribute being\n maintained in the variable (e.g., User ID, Transaction ID) must be\n automatically transmitted to any child threads that are created.
