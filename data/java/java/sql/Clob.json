{"package_name": "java.sql", "subclass_list": ["NClob", "NClob"], "class_description": "The mapping in the JavaTM programming language\n for the SQL CLOB type.\n An SQL CLOB is a built-in type\n that stores a Character Large Object as a column value in a row of\n a database table.\n By default drivers implement a Clob object using an SQL\n locator(CLOB), which means that a Clob object\n contains a logical pointer to the SQL CLOB data rather than\n the data itself. A Clob object is valid for the duration\n of the transaction in which it was created. The Clob interface provides methods for getting the\n length of an SQL CLOB (Character Large Object) value,\n for materializing a CLOB value on the client, and for\n searching for a substring or CLOB object within a\n CLOB value.\n Methods in the interfaces ResultSet,\n CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as\n getClob and setClob allow a programmer to\n access an SQL CLOB value.  In addition, this interface\n has methods for updating a CLOB value. All methods on the Clob interface must be fully implemented if the\n JDBC driver supports the data type.
