{"package_name": "java.sql", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "The interface used to execute SQL stored procedures.  The JDBC API\n provides a stored procedure SQL escape syntax that allows stored procedures\n to be called in a standard way for all RDBMSs. This escape syntax has one\n form that includes a result parameter and one that does not. If used, the result\n parameter must be registered as an OUT parameter. The other parameters\n can be used for input, output or both. Parameters are referred to\n sequentially, by number, with the first parameter being 1. IN parameter values are set using the set methods inherited from\n PreparedStatement.  The type of all OUT parameters must be\n registered prior to executing the stored procedure; their values\n are retrieved after execution via the get methods provided here. A CallableStatement can return one ResultSet object or\n multiple ResultSet objects.  Multiple\n ResultSet objects are handled using operations\n inherited from Statement. For maximum portability, a call's ResultSet objects and\n update counts should be processed prior to getting the values of output\n parameters.
