{"package_name": "java.sql", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "The mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL REF\n value, which is a reference to an SQL structured type value in the database. SQL REF values are stored in a table that contains\n instances of a referenceable SQL structured type, and each REF\n value is a unique identifier for one instance in that table.\n An SQL REF value may be used in place of the\n SQL structured type it references, either as a column value in a\n table or an attribute value in a structured type. Because an SQL REF value is a logical pointer to an\n SQL structured type, a Ref object is by default also a logical\n pointer. Thus, retrieving an SQL REF value as\n a Ref object does not materialize\n the attributes of the structured type on the client. A Ref object can be stored in the database using the\n PreparedStatement.setRef method. All methods on the Ref interface must be fully implemented if the\n JDBC driver supports the data type.
