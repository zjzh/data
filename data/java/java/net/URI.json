{"package_name": "java.net", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) reference. Aside from some minor deviations noted below, an instance of this\n class represents a URI reference as defined by\n RFC\u00a02396: Uniform\n Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax, amended by RFC\u00a02732: Format for\n Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs. The Literal IPv6 address format\n also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described\n here.\n This class provides constructors for creating URI instances from\n their components or by parsing their string forms, methods for accessing the\n various components of an instance, and methods for normalizing, resolving,\n and relativizing URI instances.  Instances of this class are immutable. An absolute URI specifies a scheme; a URI that is not absolute is\n said to be relative.  URIs are also classified according to whether\n they are opaque or hierarchical. An opaque URI is an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part does\n not begin with a slash character ('/').  Opaque URIs are not\n subject to further parsing.  Some examples of opaque URIs are: A hierarchical URI is either an absolute URI whose\n scheme-specific part begins with a slash character, or a relative URI, that\n is, a URI that does not specify a scheme.  Some examples of hierarchical\n URIs are: A hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax The authority component of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either\n server-based or registry-based.  A server-based authority\n parses according to the familiar syntax The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute\n if it begins with a slash character ('/'); otherwise it is\n relative.  The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or\n specifies an authority is always absolute. All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components: Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance\n depends upon the type of the URI being represented.  An absolute URI has a\n scheme component.  An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and\n possibly a fragment, but has no other components.  A hierarchical URI always\n has a path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at\n least contains the path), and may have any of the other components.  If the\n authority component is present and is server-based then the host component\n will be defined and the user-information and port components may be defined. Normalization is the process of removing unnecessary \".\"\n and \"..\" segments from the path component of a hierarchical URI.\n Each \".\" segment is simply removed.  A \"..\" segment is\n removed only if it is preceded by a non-\"..\" segment.\n Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs. Resolution is the process of resolving one URI against another,\n base URI.  The resulting URI is constructed from components of both\n URIs in the manner specified by RFC\u00a02396, taking components from the\n base URI for those not specified in the original.  For hierarchical URIs,\n the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then\n normalized.  The result, for example, of resolving Relativization, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any\n two normalized URIs u and\u00a0v, The set of all legal URI characters consists of\n the unreserved, reserved, escaped, and other\n characters. The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the\n differences between this class and the URL class. An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic\n sense defined by RFC\u00a02396.  A URI may be either absolute or relative.\n A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the\n scheme, if any, that it specifies.  No lookup of the host, if any, is\n performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed.  Equality,\n hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character\n content of the instance.  In other words, a URI instance is little more than\n a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent\n operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization. An instance of the URL class, by contrast, represents the\n syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required\n to access the resource that it describes.  A URL must be absolute, that is,\n it must always specify a scheme.  A URL string is parsed according to its\n scheme.  A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is\n impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is\n available.  Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the\n Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined.  In other\n words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of\n resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and\n opening a connection to the specified resource.

This allows the parsing of URIs such as\n   \"file:///foo/bar\", which seems to be the intent of\n   RFC\u00a02396 although the grammar does not permit it.
