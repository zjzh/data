{"package_name": "java.net", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "This class represents an Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address.\n Defined by \nRFC\u00a0790: Assigned Numbers,\n \nRFC\u00a01918: Address Allocation for Private Internets,\n and RFC\u00a02365:\n Administratively Scoped IP Multicast When four parts are specified, each is interpreted as a byte of\n data and assigned, from left to right, to the four bytes of an IPv4\n address. When a three part address is specified, the last part is\n interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in the right most two\n bytes of the network address. This makes the three part address\n format convenient for specifying Class B net- work addresses as\n 128.net.host. When a two part address is supplied, the last part is\n interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the right most three\n bytes of the network address. This makes the two part address\n format convenient for specifying Class A network addresses as\n net.host. When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in\n the network address without any byte rearrangement. For methods that return a textual representation as output\n value, the first form, i.e. a dotted-quad string, is used.
