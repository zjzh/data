For methods that return a textual representation as output\n value, the full form is used. Inet6Address will return the full\n form because it is unambiguous when used in combination with other\n textual data. The textual representation of IPv6 addresses as described above can be\n extended to specify IPv6 scoped addresses. This extension to the basic\n addressing architecture is described in [draft-ietf-ipngwg-scoping-arch-04.txt]. Because link-local and site-local addresses are non-global, it is possible\n that different hosts may have the same destination address and may be\n reachable through different interfaces on the same originating system. In\n this case, the originating system is said to be connected to multiple zones\n of the same scope. In order to disambiguate which is the intended destination\n zone, it is possible to append a zone identifier (or scope_id) to an\n IPv6 address. The general format for specifying the scope_id is the following: The IPv6-address is a literal IPv6 address as described above.\n The scope_id refers to an interface on the local system, and it can be\n specified in two ways. Note also, that the numeric scope_id can be retrieved from\n Inet6Address instances returned from the NetworkInterface class. This can be\n used to find out the current scope ids configured on the system.
