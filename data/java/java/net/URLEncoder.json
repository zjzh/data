When encoding a String, the following rules apply: For example using UTF-8 as the encoding scheme the string \"The\n string \u00fc@foo-bar\" would get converted to\n \"The+string+%C3%BC%40foo-bar\" because in UTF-8 the character\n \u00fc is encoded as two bytes C3 (hex) and BC (hex), and the\n character @ is encoded as one byte 40 (hex).
