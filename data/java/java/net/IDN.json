{"package_name": "java.net", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Provides methods to convert internationalized domain names (IDNs) between\n a normal Unicode representation and an ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) representation.\n Internationalized domain names can use characters from the entire range of\n Unicode, while traditional domain names are restricted to ASCII characters.\n ACE is an encoding of Unicode strings that uses only ASCII characters and\n can be used with software (such as the Domain Name System) that only\n understands traditional domain names. Internationalized domain names are defined in RFC 3490.\n RFC 3490 defines two operations: ToASCII and ToUnicode. These 2 operations employ\n Nameprep algorithm, which is a\n profile of Stringprep, and\n Punycode algorithm to convert\n domain name string back and forth. The behavior of aforementioned conversion process can be adjusted by various flags: The security consideration is important with respect to internationalization\n domain name support. For example, English domain names may be homographed\n - maliciously misspelled by substitution of non-Latin letters.\n Unicode Technical Report #36\n discusses security issues of IDN support as well as possible solutions.\n Applications are responsible for taking adequate security measures when using\n international domain names.
