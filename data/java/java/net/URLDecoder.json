This class contains static methods\n for decoding a String from the application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n MIME format. The conversion process is the reverse of that used by the URLEncoder class. It is assumed\n that all characters in the encoded string are one of the following:\n \"a\" through \"z\",\n \"A\" through \"Z\",\n \"0\" through \"9\", and\n \"-\", \"_\",\n \".\", and \"*\". The\n character \"%\" is allowed but is interpreted\n as the start of a special escaped sequence. The following rules are applied in the conversion: There are two possible ways in which this decoder could deal with\n illegal strings.  It could either leave illegal characters alone or\n it could throw an IllegalArgumentException.\n Which approach the decoder takes is left to the\n implementation.
