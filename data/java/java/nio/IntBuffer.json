{"package_name": "java.nio", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "An int buffer. This class defines four categories of operations upon\n int buffers: Int buffers can be created either by allocation, which allocates space for the buffer's\n\n\n content, by wrapping an existing\n int array  into a buffer, or by creating a\n view of an existing byte buffer. Like a byte buffer, an int buffer is either direct or non-direct.  A\n int buffer created via the wrap methods of this class will\n be non-direct.  An int buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will\n be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not\n an int buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the isDirect method. Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are\n specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows\n method invocations to be chained.
