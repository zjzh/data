{"package_name": "java.nio", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A long buffer. This class defines four categories of operations upon\n long buffers: Long buffers can be created either by allocation, which allocates space for the buffer's\n\n\n content, by wrapping an existing\n long array  into a buffer, or by creating a\n view of an existing byte buffer. Like a byte buffer, a long buffer is either direct or non-direct.  A\n long buffer created via the wrap methods of this class will\n be non-direct.  A long buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will\n be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not\n a long buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the isDirect method. Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are\n specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows\n method invocations to be chained.
