An implementation of this interface is provided to the\n Files#walkFileTree methods to visit each file in\n a file tree. Usage Examples:\n Suppose we want to delete a file tree. In that case, each directory should\n be deleted after the entries in the directory are deleted. Furthermore, suppose we want to copy a file tree to a target location.\n In that case, symbolic links should be followed and the target directory\n should be created before the entries in the directory are copied.
