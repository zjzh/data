An event is classified by its kind and has a count to indicate the number of times that the event has been\n observed. This allows for efficient representation of repeated events. The\n context method returns any context associated with\n the event. In the case of a repeated event then the context is the same for\n all events. Watch events are immutable and safe for use by multiple concurrent\n threads.
