{"package_name": "java.nio.file.attribute", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A file attribute view that supports reading or updating a file's Access\n Control Lists (ACL) or file owner attributes. ACLs are used to specify access rights to file system objects. An ACL is\n an ordered list of AclEntry, each specifying a\n UserPrincipal and the level of access for that user principal. This\n file attribute view defines the getAcl, and setAcl methods to read and write ACLs based on the ACL\n model specified in RFC\u00a03530:\n Network File System (NFS) version 4 Protocol. This file attribute view\n is intended for file system implementations that support the NFSv4 ACL model\n or have a well-defined mapping between the NFSv4 ACL model and the ACL\n model used by the file system. The details of such mapping are implementation\n dependent and are therefore unspecified. This class also extends FileOwnerAttributeView so as to define\n methods to get and set the file owner. When a file system provides access to a set of FileStore that are not homogeneous then only some of the file systems may\n support ACLs. The FileStore#supportsFileAttributeView method can be used to test if a file system\n supports ACLs.
