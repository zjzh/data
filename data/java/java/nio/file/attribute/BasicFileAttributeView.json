Where dynamic access to file attributes is required, the attributes\n supported by this attribute view have the following names and types: The getAttribute method may be\n used to read any of these attributes as if by invoking the readAttributes() method. The setAttribute method may be\n used to update the file's last modified time, last access time or create time\n attributes as if by invoking the setTimes method.
