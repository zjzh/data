{"package_name": "java.nio.file.attribute", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A file attribute view that provides a view of the file attributes commonly\n associated with files on file systems used by operating systems that implement\n the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) family of standards. Operating systems that implement the \n POSIX family of standards commonly use file systems that have a\n file owner, group-owner, and related access\n permissions. This file attribute view provides read and write access\n to these attributes. The readAttributes method is used to read the\n file's attributes. The file PosixFileAttributes#owner() is\n represented by a UserPrincipal that is the identity of the file owner\n for the purposes of access control. The PosixFileAttributes#group(), represented by a GroupPrincipal, is the identity of the\n group owner, where a group is an identity created for administrative purposes\n so as to determine the access rights for the members of the group. The PosixFileAttributes#permissions() attribute is a\n set of access permissions. This file attribute view provides access to the nine\n permission defined by the PosixFilePermission class.\n These nine permission bits determine the read, write, and\n execute access for the file owner, group, and others (others\n meaning identities other than the owner and members of the group). Some\n operating systems and file systems may provide additional permission bits\n but access to these other bits is not defined by this class in this release. Usage Example:\n Suppose we need to print out the owner and access permissions of a file: ", "class_type": "interface", "typealias": [], "interface_list": ["BasicFileAttributeView", "FileOwnerAttributeView"], "class_inherit_list": [], "Methods": [], "class_name": "PosixFileAttributeView", "Vars": null}
