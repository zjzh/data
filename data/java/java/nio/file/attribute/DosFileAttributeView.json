A DosFileAttributeView is a BasicFileAttributeView that\n additionally supports access to the set of DOS attribute flags that are used\n to indicate if the file is read-only, hidden, a system file, or archived. Where dynamic access to file attributes is required, the attributes\n supported by this attribute view are as defined by BasicFileAttributeView, and in addition, the following attributes are\n supported: The getAttribute method may\n be used to read any of these attributes, or any of the attributes defined by\n BasicFileAttributeView as if by invoking the readAttributes() method. The setAttribute method may\n be used to update the file's last modified time, last access time or create\n time attributes as defined by BasicFileAttributeView. It may also be\n used to update the DOS attributes as if by invoking the setReadOnly, setHidden, setSystem, and\n setArchive methods respectively.
