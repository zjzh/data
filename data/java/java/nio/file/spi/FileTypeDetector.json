{"package_name": "java.nio.file.spi", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A file type detector for probing a file to guess its file type. A file type detector is a concrete implementation of this class, has a\n zero-argument constructor, and implements the abstract methods specified\n below. The means by which a file type detector determines the file type is\n highly implementation specific. A simple implementation might examine the\n file extension (a convention used in some platforms) and map it to\n a file type. In other cases, the file type may be stored as a file  attribute or the bytes in a\n file may be examined to guess its file type.
