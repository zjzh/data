This class defines methods for creating decoders and encoders and\n for retrieving the various names associated with a charset.  Instances of\n this class are immutable. This class also defines static methods for testing whether a particular\n charset is supported, for locating charset instances by name, and for\n constructing a map that contains every charset for which support is\n available in the current Java virtual machine.  Support for new charsets can\n be added via the service-provider interface defined in the CharsetProvider class. All of the methods defined in this class are safe for use by multiple\n concurrent threads.
