{"package_name": "java.nio.channels", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A pair of channels that implements a unidirectional pipe. A pipe consists of a pair of channels: A writable Pipe.SinkChannel channel and a readable Pipe.SourceChannel\n channel.  Once some bytes are written to the sink channel they can be read\n from source channel in exactlyAthe order in which they were written. Whether or not a thread writing bytes to a pipe will block until another\n thread reads those bytes, or some previously-written bytes, from the pipe is\n system-dependent and therefore unspecified.  Many pipe implementations will\n buffer up to a certain number of bytes between the sink and source channels,\n but such buffering should not be assumed.
