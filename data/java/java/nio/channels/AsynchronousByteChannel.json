{"package_name": "java.nio.channels", "subclass_list": ["AsynchronousSocketChannel", "AsynchronousSocketChannel"], "class_description": "An asynchronous channel that can read and write bytes. Some channels may not allow more than one read or write to be outstanding\n at any given time. If a thread invokes a read method before a previous read\n operation has completed then a ReadPendingException will be thrown.\n Similarly, if a write method is invoked before a previous write has completed\n then WritePendingException is thrown. Whether or not other kinds of\n I/O operations may proceed concurrently with a read operation depends upon\n the type of the channel. Note that ByteBuffers are not safe for use by\n multiple concurrent threads. When a read or write operation is initiated then\n care must be taken to ensure that the buffer is not accessed until the\n operation completes.
