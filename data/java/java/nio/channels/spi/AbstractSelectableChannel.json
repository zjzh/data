This class defines methods that handle the mechanics of channel\n registration, deregistration, and closing.  It maintains the current\n blocking mode of this channel as well as its current set of selection keys.\n It performs all of the synchronization required to implement the SelectableChannel specification.  Implementations of the\n abstract protected methods defined in this class need not synchronize\n against other threads that might be engaged in the same operations.
