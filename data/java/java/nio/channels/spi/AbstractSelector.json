{"package_name": "java.nio.channels.spi", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "Base implementation class for selectors. This class encapsulates the low-level machinery required to implement\n the interruption of selection operations.  A concrete selector class must\n invoke the begin and end methods before and\n after, respectively, invoking an I/O operation that might block\n indefinitely.  In order to ensure that the end method is always\n invoked, these methods should be used within a\n try\u00a0...\u00a0finally block: This class also defines methods for maintaining a selector's\n cancelled-key set and for removing a key from its channel's key set, and\n declares the abstract register method that is invoked by a\n selectable channel's AbstractSelectableChannel#register\n method in order to perform the actual work of registering a channel.
