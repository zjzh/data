A gathering write operation writes, in a single invocation, a\n sequence of bytes from one or more of a given sequence of buffers.\n Gathering writes are often useful when implementing network protocols or\n file formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one\n or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar\n scattering read operations are defined in the ScatteringByteChannel interface.
