{"package_name": "java.nio.channels", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "A token representing the membership of an Internet Protocol (IP) multicast\n group. A membership key may represent a membership to receive all datagrams sent\n to the group, or it may be source-specific, meaning that it\n represents a membership that receives only datagrams from a specific source\n address. Whether or not a membership key is source-specific may be determined\n by invoking its sourceAddress method. A membership key is valid upon creation and remains valid until the\n membership is dropped by invoking the drop method, or\n the channel is closed. The validity of the membership key may be tested\n by invoking its isValid method. Where a membership key is not source-specific and the underlying operation\n system supports source filtering, then the block and unblock methods can be used to block or unblock multicast datagrams\n from particular source addresses.
