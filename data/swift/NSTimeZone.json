{"class_description": "Time zones represent the standard time policies for a geopolitical region. Time zones have identifiers like \u201cAmerica/Los_Angeles\u201d and can also be identified by abbreviations, such as PST for Pacific Standard Time. You can create time zone objects by ID with init(name:) and by abbreviation with init(abbreviation:). \nNote\nTime zone database entries such as \u201cAmerica/Los_Angeles\u201d are IDs, not names. An example of a time zone name is \u201cPacific Daylight Time\u201d. Although many NSTimeZone symbols include the word \u201cname\u201d, they actually refer to IDs.\nTime zones can also represent a temporal offset\u2014either plus or minus\u2014from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). For example, the temporal offset of Pacific Standard Time is 8 hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT-8). You can create time zone objects with a temporal offset by using init(forSecondsFromGMT:).\nYou typically work with system time zones rather than creating time zones by identifier or by offset. The system class property returns the time zone currently used by the system, if known. This value is cached once the property is accessed and doesn't reflect any system time zone changes until you call the resetSystemTimeZone() method. The local class property returns an autoupdating proxy object that always returns the current time zone used by the system. You can also set the default class property to make your app run as if it were in a different time zone than the system. \nTip\nYou can't use NSTimeZone APIs to change the time zone of the device or of other apps.\n\nNSTimeZone is toll-free bridged with its Core Foundation counterpart, CFTimeZone. See Toll-Free Bridging for more information on toll-free bridging.\nImportant\nThe Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the TimeZone structure, which bridges to the NSTimeZone class.
