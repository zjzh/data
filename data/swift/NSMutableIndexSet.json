{"class_description": "The NSMutableIndexSet class represents a mutable collection of unique unsigned integers, known as indexes because of the way they are used. This collection is referred to as a mutable index set. The inclusive range of valid indexes is 0...(NSNotFound - 1); trying to use indexes outside this range is invalid.\nThe values in a mutable index set are always sorted, so the order in which values are added is irrelevant.\nDo not subclass the NSMutableIndexSet class.\nImportant\nThe Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the IndexSet structure, which bridges to the NSMutableIndexSet class and its immutable superclass, NSIndexSet. For more information about value types, see Working with Cocoa Frameworks in Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4.1). \n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSIndexSet"], "class_name": "NSMutableIndexSet", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "Sequence"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
