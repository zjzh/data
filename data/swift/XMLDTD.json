{"class_description": "An instance of the XMLDTD class is held as a property of an XMLDocument instance, accessed through the XMLDocument method dtd (and set via setDTD:).\nIn the data model, an XMLDTD object is conceptually similar to namespace and attribute nodes: it is not considered to be a child of the XMLDocument object although it is closely associated with it. It is at the \u201croot\u201d of a shallow tree consisting primarily of nodes representing DTD declarations. Acceptable child nodes are instances of the XMLDTDNode class as well as XMLNode objects representing comment nodes and processing-instruction nodes.\nYou create an NSXMLDTD object in one of three ways: \nBy processing an XML document with its own internal (in-line) DTD\nBy process a standalone (external) DTD\nProgrammatically\nOnce an XMLDTD instance is in place, you can add, remove, and change the XMLDTDNode objects representing various DTD declarations. When you write the document out as XML, the new or modified internal DTD is included (assuming you set the DTD in the XMLDocument instance). You may also programmatically create an external DTD and write that out to its own file.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["XMLNode"], "class_name": "XMLDTD", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
