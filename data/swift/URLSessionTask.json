{"class_description": "The URLSessionTask class is the base class for tasks in a URL session. Tasks are always part of a session; you create a task by calling one of the task creation methods on a URLSession instance. The method you call determines the type of task.\nUse URLSession\u2019s dataTask(with:) and related methods to create URLSessionDataTask instances. Data tasks request a resource, returning the server\u2019s response as one or more NSData objects in memory. They are supported in default, ephemeral, and shared sessions, but are not supported in background sessions.\nUse URLSession\u2019s uploadTask(with:from:) and related methods to create URLSessionUploadTask instances. Upload tasks are like data tasks, except that they make it easier to provide a request body so you can upload data before retrieving the server\u2019s response. Additionally, upload tasks are supported in background sessions.\nUse URLSession\u2019s downloadTask(with:) and related methods to create URLSessionDownloadTask instances. Download tasks download a resource directly to a file on disk. Download tasks are supported in any type of session.\nUse URLSession\u2019s streamTask(withHostName:port:) or streamTask(with:) to create URLSessionStreamTask instances. Stream tasks establish a TCP/IP connection from a host name and port or a net service object.\nAfter you create a task, you start it by calling its resume() method. The session then maintains a strong reference to the task until the request finishes or fails; you don\u2019t need to maintain a reference to the task unless it\u2019s useful for your app\u2019s internal bookkeeping.\nNote\nAll task properties support key-value observing.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "URLSessionTask", "typealias": [], "Vars": [{"var_description": "The total size of the transfer cannot be determined.", "var_type": "Int64", "is_static": false, "var_name": "NSURLSessionTransferSizeUnknown"}, {"var_description": "The total size of the transfer cannot be determined.", "var_type": "Int64", "is_static": false, "var_name": "NSURLSessionTransferSizeUnknown"}], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying", "ProgressReporting"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
