{"class_description": "You typically use instances of NSUnitFrequency to represent specific quantities of frequency using the NSMeasurement class.\nFrequency is a quantity of occurrences for a repeating event over time. The SI unit for frequency is the hertz (Hz), which is a derived as one occurrence per second (1Hz = 1 / 1s).\nThe NSUnitFrequency class defines its base unit as hertz, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nCoefficient\nTerahertz\nterahertz\nTHz\n1e12\nGigahertz\ngigahertz\nGHz\n1e9\nMegahertz\nmegahertz\nMHz\n1000000.0\nKilohertz\nkilohertz\nkHz\n1000.0\nHertz\nhertz\nHz\n1\nMillihertz\nmillihertz\nmHz\n0.001\nMicrohertz\nmicrohertz\n\u00b5Hz\n0.000001\nNanohertz\nnanohertz\nnHz\n1e-9\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Dimension"], "class_name": "UnitFrequency", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
