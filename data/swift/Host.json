{"class_description": "The Host class provides methods to access the network name and address information for a host. Instances of the Host class represent individual hosts on a network. Use Host objects  to get the current host\u2019s names and addresses and to look up other hosts by name or by address.\nTo create an Host object, use the current(), init(address:), or init(name:) class methods (don\u2019t use alloc and init). These methods use available network administration services to discover all names and addresses for the host requested. They don\u2019t attempt to contact the host itself, however. This approach avoids untimely delays due to a host being unavailable, but it may result in incomplete information about the host.\nAn Host object contains all of the network addresses and names discovered for a given host by the network administration services. Each Host object may contain several addresses and have more than one name. If an Host object has more than one name, the additional names are variations on the same name, typically the basic host name plus the fully qualified domain name. For example, with a host name \"sales\" in the domain \"anycorp.com\", an Host object can hold both the names \"sales\" and \"sales.anycorp.com\".\nHost methods are thread-safe.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "Host", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
