{"class_description": "Predicates represent logical conditions, which you can use to filter collections of objects. Although it's common to create predicates directly from instances of NSComparisonPredicate,  NSCompoundPredicate, and NSExpression, you often create predicates from a format string which is parsed by the class methods on NSPredicate. Examples of predicate format strings include:\nSimple comparisons, such as grade == \"7\" or firstName like \"Shaffiq\"\nCase and diacritic insensitive lookups, such as name contains[cd] \"itroen\"\nLogical operations, such as (firstName like \"Mark\") OR (lastName like \"Adderley\")\nTemporal range constraints, such as date between {$YESTERDAY, $TOMORROW}.\nRelational conditions, such as group.name like \"work*\"\nAggregate operations, such as @sum.items.price < 1000\nFor a complete syntax reference, refer to the Predicate Programming Guide.\nYou can also create predicates that include variables using the evaluate(with:substitutionVariables:) method, so that the predicate can be predefined before substituting concrete values at runtime.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSPredicate", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
