{"class_description": "You typically use instances of NSUnitAngle to represent specific quantities of planar angle using the NSMeasurement class.\nAngle is a quantity of rotation. The SI unit for angle is the radian (rad), which is dimensionless and defined to be the the angle subtended by an arc that is equal in length to the radius of a circle. Angle is also commonly expressed in terms of degrees (\u00b0) and revolutions (rev).\nThe NSUnitAngle class defines its base unit as degrees, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nDefinition\nDegrees\ndegrees\n\u00b0\n1.0\nArc Minutes\narcMinutes\n\u02b9\n0.016667\nArc Seconds\narcSeconds\n\u02ba\n0.00027778\nRadians\nradians\nrad\n57.2958\nGradians\ngradians\ngrad\n0.9\nRevolutions\nrevolutions\nrev\n360\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Dimension"], "class_name": "UnitAngle", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
