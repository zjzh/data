{"class_description": "NSURLRequest encapsulates two basic data elements of a load request: the URL to load, and the policy to use when consulting the URL content cache made available by the implementation.\nImportant\nThis class serves only to encapsulate information about a URL request. You must use other classes such as URLSession to send these requests to a server. See Fetching Website Data into Memory and Uploading Data to a Website for an introduction to these techniques.\nNSURLRequest is designed to be extended to support additional protocols by creating extensions that provide accessor methods for your own protocol-specific properties. Those methods can get and set the actual values by calling the URLProtocol methods property(forKey:in:) and setProperty(_:forKey:in:).\nThe mutable subclass of NSURLRequest is NSMutableURLRequest.\nImportant\nThe Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the URLRequest structure, which bridges to the NSURLRequest class and its mutable subclass, NSMutableURLRequest. For more information about value types, see Working with Cocoa Frameworks in Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4.1).\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSURLRequest", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying", "NSMutableCopying", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
