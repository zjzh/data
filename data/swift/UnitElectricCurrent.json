{"class_description": "You typically use instances of NSUnitElectricCurrent to represent specific quantities of electric current using the NSMeasurement class.\nElectric current is the flow of electric charge. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), which is defined in terms the production of electromagnetic force between two parallel linear conductors. It can also be expressed as the flow of one coulomb per second (1A = 1C / s).\nThe NSUnitElectricCurrent class defines its base unit as amperes, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nCoefficient\nMegaamperes\nmegaamperes\nMA\n1000000.0\nKiloamperes\nkiloamperes\nkA\n1000.0\nAmperes\namperes\nA\n1.0\nMilliamperes\nmilliamperes\nmA\n0.001\nMicroamperes\nmicroamperes\n\u00b5A\n0.000001\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Dimension"], "class_name": "UnitElectricCurrent", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
