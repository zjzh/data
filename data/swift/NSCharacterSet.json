{"class_description": "An NSCharacterSet object represents a set of Unicode-compliant characters. NSString and NSScanner objects use NSCharacterSet objects to group characters together for searching operations, so that they can find any of a particular set of characters during a search. The cluster\u2019s two public classes, NSCharacterSet and NSMutableCharacterSet, declare the programmatic interface for static and dynamic character sets, respectively.\nThe objects you create using these classes are referred to as character set objects (and when no confusion will result, merely as character sets). Because of the nature of class clusters, character set objects aren\u2019t actual instances of the NSCharacterSet or NSMutableCharacterSet classes but of one of their private subclasses. Although a character set object\u2019s class is private, its interface is public, as declared by these abstract superclasses, NSCharacterSet and NSMutableCharacterSet. The character set classes adopt the NSCopying and NSMutableCopying protocols, making it convenient to convert a character set of one type to the other.\nThe NSCharacterSet class declares the programmatic interface for an object that manages a set of Unicode characters (see the NSString class cluster specification for information on Unicode). NSCharacterSet\u2019s principal primitive method, characterIsMember(_:), provides the basis for all other instance methods in its interface. A subclass of NSCharacterSet needs only to implement this method, plus mutableCopy(with:), for proper behavior. For optimal performance, a subclass should also override bitmapRepresentation, which otherwise works by invoking characterIsMember(_:) for every possible Unicode value.\nNSCharacterSet is \u201ctoll-free bridged\u201d with its Core Foundation counterpart, CFCharacterSet. See Toll-Free Bridging for more information on toll-free bridging.\nImportant\nThe Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the CharacterSet structure, which bridges to the NSCharacterSet class and its mutable subclass, NSMutableCharacterSet.
