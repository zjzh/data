{"class_description": "An NSDateInterval object represents a closed interval between two dates. The NSDateInterval class provides a programmatic interface for calculating the duration of a time interval and determining whether a date falls within it, as well as comparing date intervals and checking to see whether they intersect.\nAn NSDateInterval object consists of a startDate and an endDate. The startDate and endDate of a date interval can be equal, in which case its duration is 0. However, endDate cannot occur earlier than startDate.\nYou can use the DateIntervalFormatter class to create string representations of NSDateInterval objects that are suitable for display in the current locale.\nImportant\nThe Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the DateInterval structure, which bridges to the NSDateInterval class. For more information about value types, see Working with Cocoa Frameworks in Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4.1).\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSDateInterval", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
