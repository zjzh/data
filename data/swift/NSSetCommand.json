{"class_description": "An instance of NSSetCommand sets one or more attributes or relationships to one or more values; for example, it may set the (x, y) coordinates for a window\u2019s position or set the name of a document.\nNSSetCommand is part of Cocoa\u2019s built-in scripting support. It works automatically to support the set command through key-value coding. Most applications don\u2019t need to subclass NSSetCommand or call its methods.\nNSSetCommand uses available scripting class descriptions to determine whether it should set a value for an attribute (or property), or set a value for all elements (to-many objects). For the latter, it invokes replaceValue(at:inPropertyWithKey:withValue:); for the former, it invokes setValue(_:forKey:) (or, if the receiver overrides takeValue:forKey:, it invokes that method, to support backward binary compatibility.)\nFor information on working with set commands, see Getting and Setting Properties and Elements in Cocoa Scripting Guide.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSScriptCommand"], "class_name": "NSSetCommand", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
