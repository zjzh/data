{"class_description": "TimeZone defines the behavior of a time zone. Time zone values represent geopolitical regions. Consequently, these values have names for these regions. Time zone values also represent a temporal offset, either plus or minus, from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and an abbreviation (such as PST for Pacific Standard Time).\nTimeZone provides two static functions to get time zone values: current and autoupdatingCurrent. The autoupdatingCurrent time zone automatically tracks updates made by the user.\nNote that time zone database entries such as \u201cAmerica/Los_Angeles\u201d are IDs, not names. An example of a time zone name is \u201cPacific Daylight Time\u201d. Although many TimeZone functions include the word \u201cname\u201d, they refer to IDs.\nCocoa does not provide any API to change the time zone of the computer, or of other applications.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": [], "class_name": "TimeZone", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "struct", "interface_list": ["CustomDebugStringConvertible", "CustomReflectable", "CustomStringConvertible", "Equatable", "Hashable", "ReferenceConvertible"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
