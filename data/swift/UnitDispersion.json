{"class_description": "You typically use instances of NSUnitDispersion to represent specific quantities of dispersion using the NSMeasurement class.\nDispersion describes the the amount of a constituent divided by the amount of all other constituents in a mixture. Dispersion is a dimensionless quantity that is commonly expressed in \u201cparts-per\u201d notation, such as \u201cparts per million\u201d (ppm), to describe small relative quantities.\nThe NSUnitDispersion class defines its base unit as partsPerMillion.\nName\nMethod\nAbbreviation\nParts Per Million\npartsPerMillion\nppm\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Dimension"], "class_name": "UnitDispersion", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
