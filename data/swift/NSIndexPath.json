{"class_description": "Each index in an index path represents the index into an array of children from one node in the tree to another, deeper, node. For example, the index path 1.4.3.2 specifies the path shown in Figure 1.\nIndex path 1.4.3.2\nNote\nThe UIKit framework adds programming interfaces to the NSIndexPath class of the Foundation framework to facilitate the identification of rows and sections in UITableView objects and the identification of items and sections in UICollectionView objects. The API consists of class factory methods and properties for accessing the various indexed values. You use the factory methods to create an index path for the corresponding table view or collection view.\nImportant\nThe Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the IndexPath structure, which bridges to the NSIndexPath class.
