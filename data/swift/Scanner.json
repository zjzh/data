{"class_description": "A Scanner object interprets and converts the characters of a String into number and string values. You assign the scanner\u2019s string when you create the scanner, and the scanner progresses through the characters of that string from beginning to end as you request items. \nBecause of the nature of class clusters, a scanner object isn\u2019t an actual instance of the Scanner class, but is one of its private subclasses. Although a scanner object\u2019s class is private, its interface is public, as declared by this abstract superclass, Scanner. The objects you create using this class are referred to as scanner objects (and when no confusion will result, merely as scanners). \nTo set a Scanner object to ignore a set of characters as it scans the string, use the charactersToBeSkipped property. Characters in the skip set are skipped over before the target is scanned. The default set of characters to skip is the whitespace and newline character set.\nTo retrieve the unscanned remainder of the string, use scanner.string.substring(from: scanner.scanLocation). \n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "Scanner", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
