{"class_description": "Use NSException to implement exception handling. An exception is a special condition that interrupts the normal flow of program execution. Each application can interrupt the program for different reasons. For example, one application might interpret saving a file in a directory that is write-protected as an exception. In this sense, the exception is equivalent to an error. Another application might interpret the user\u2019s key-press (for example, Control-C) as an exception: an indication that a long-running process should abort.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSException", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCoding", "NSCopying"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
