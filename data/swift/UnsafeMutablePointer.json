The type of data that a pointer can access is the pointer\u2019s Pointee type. UnsafeMutablePointer provides no automated memory management or alignment guarantees. You are responsible for handling the life cycle of any memory you work with through unsafe pointers to avoid leaks or undefined behavior.\nMemory that you manually manage can be either untyped or bound to a specific type. You use the UnsafeMutablePointer type to access and manage memory that has been bound to a specific type.\nThe memory referenced by an UnsafeMutablePointer instance can be in one of several states. Many pointer operations must only be applied to pointers with memory in a specific state\u2014you must keep track of the state of the memory you are working with and understand the changes to that state that different operations perform. Memory can be untyped and uninitialized, bound to a type and uninitialized, or bound to a type and initialized to a value. Finally, memory that was allocated previously may have been deallocated, leaving existing pointers referencing unallocated memory.\nMemory that has just been allocated through a typed pointer or has been deinitialized is in an uninitialized state. Uninitialized memory must be initialized before it can be accessed for reading.\nYou can use methods like initialize(to:count:), initialize(from:count:), and moveInitialize(from:count:) to initialize the memory referenced by a pointer with a value or series of values.\nInitialized memory has a value that can be read using a pointer\u2019s pointee property or through subscript notation. In the following example, ptr is a pointer to memory initialized with a value of 23:\nWhen you access memory through an UnsafeMutablePointer instance, the Pointee type must be consistent with the bound type of the memory. If you do need to access memory that is bound to one type as a different type, Swift\u2019s pointer types provide type-safe ways to temporarily or permanently change the bound type of the memory, or to load typed instances directly from raw memory.\nAn UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8> instance allocated with eight bytes of memory, uint8Pointer, will be used for the examples below.\nWhen you only need to temporarily access a pointer\u2019s memory as a different type, use the withMemoryRebound(to:capacity:) method. For example, you can use this method to call an API that expects a pointer to a different type that is layout compatible with your pointer\u2019s Pointee. The following code temporarily rebinds the memory that uint8Pointer references from UInt8 to Int8 to call the imported C strlen function.\nWhen you need to permanently rebind memory to a different type, first obtain a raw pointer to the memory and then call the bindMemory(to:capacity:) method on the raw pointer. The following example binds the memory referenced by uint8Pointer to one instance of the UInt64 type:\nAfter rebinding the memory referenced by uint8Pointer to UInt64, accessing that pointer\u2019s referenced memory as a UInt8 instance is undefined.\nAlternatively, you can access the same memory as a different type without rebinding through untyped memory access, so long as the bound type and the destination type are trivial types. Convert your pointer to an UnsafeMutableRawPointer instance and then use the raw pointer\u2019s load(fromByteOffset:as:) and storeBytes(of:toByteOffset:as:) methods to read and write values.\nPointer arithmetic with a typed pointer is counted in strides of the pointer\u2019s Pointee type. When you add to or subtract from an UnsafeMutablePointer instance, the result is a new pointer of the same type, offset by that number of instances of the Pointee type.\nYou can also use subscript notation to access the value in memory at a specific offset.\nWhen calling a function or method with an UnsafeMutablePointer parameter, you can pass an instance of that specific pointer type or use Swift\u2019s implicit bridging to pass a compatible pointer.\nFor example, the printInt(atAddress:) function in the following code sample expects an UnsafeMutablePointer<Int> instance as its first parameter:\nAs is typical in Swift, you can call the printInt(atAddress:) function with an UnsafeMutablePointer instance. This example passes intPointer, a mutable pointer to an Int value, to print(address:).\nAlternatively, you can use Swift\u2019s implicit bridging to pass a pointer to an instance or to the elements of an array. The following example passes a pointer to the value variable by using inout syntax:\nA mutable pointer to the elements of an array is implicitly created when you pass the array using inout syntax. This example uses implicit bridging to pass a pointer to the elements of numbers when calling printInt(atAddress:).\nNo matter which way you call printInt(atAddress:), Swift\u2019s type safety guarantees that you can only pass a pointer to the type required by the function\u2014in this case, a pointer to an Int.\nImportant\nThe pointer created through implicit bridging of an instance or of an array\u2019s elements is only valid during the execution of the called function. Escaping the pointer to use after the execution of the function is undefined behavior. In particular, do not use implicit bridging when calling an UnsafeMutablePointer initializer.\n", "class_inherit_list": [], "package_name": "swift", "subclass_list": [], "class_type": "struct", "typealias": []}
