{"class_description": "The NSURLComponents class is a class that is designed to parse URLs based on RFC 3986 and to construct URLs from their constituent parts. Its behavior differs subtly from the NSURL class, which conforms to older RFCs. However, you can easily obtain an NSURL object based on the contents of a URL components object or vice versa.\nYou create a URL components object in one of three ways: from an NSString object that contains a URL, from an NSURL object, or from scratch by using the default initializer. From there, you can modify the URL\u2019s individual components and subcomponents by modifying various properties, either in unencoded form or in URL-encoded form. If you set the unencoded property, you can then obtain the encoded equivalent by reading the encoded property value and vice versa.\nImportant\nThe Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the URLComponents structure, which bridges to the NSURLComponents class. For more information about value types, see Working with Cocoa Frameworks in Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4.1).\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSURLComponents", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
