{"class_description": "The values of this enumeration indicate how to handle a task with a delayed start time (as set with the earliestBeginDate property). When the task is ready to start, it calls the urlSession(_:task:willBeginDelayedRequest:completionHandler:) method of URLSessionTaskDelegate. The implementation of this method must call the provided completion handler, passing in one case of this enumeration as the first argument. If the URLSession.DelayedRequestDisposition.useNewRequest disposition is used for the first argument, the caller must also provide a new NSURLRequest as the second argument.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": [], "class_name": "URLSession.DelayedRequestDisposition", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "enum", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
