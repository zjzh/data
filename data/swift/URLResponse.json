{"class_description": "The related HTTPURLResponse class is a commonly used subclass of URLResponse whose objects represent a response to an HTTP URL load request and store additional protocol-specific information such as the response headers. Whenever you make an HTTP request, the URLResponse object you get back is actually an instance of the HTTPURLResponse class.\nNote\nURLResponse objects don\u2019t contain the actual bytes representing the content of a URL. Instead, the data is returned either a piece at a time through delegate calls or in its entirety when the request completes, depending on the method and class used to initiate the request.\nRead Fetching Website Data into Memory to learn various ways to receive the content data from a URL load.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "URLResponse", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
