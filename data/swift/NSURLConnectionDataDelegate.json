Many methods in this protocol existed as part of an informal protocol in previous versions of macOS and iOS.\nIn addition to the methods described in this protocol, an NSURLConnection delegate should also implement the methods described in the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol.\nNote\nIf you are using NSURLConnection as part of Newsstand Kit on iOS, you should also implement the methods in the NSURLConnectionDownloadDelegate protocol.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSURLConnectionDelegate"], "class_name": "NSURLConnectionDataDelegate", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
