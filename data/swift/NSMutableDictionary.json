{"class_description": "The NSMutableDictionary class declares the programmatic interface to objects that manage mutable associations of keys and values. It adds modification operations to the basic operations it inherits from NSDictionary.\nNSMutableDictionary is \u201ctoll-free bridged\u201d with its Core Foundation counterpart, CFMutableDictionary. See Toll-Free Bridging for more information on toll-free bridging.\nIn addition to the provided instance methods, such as setObject(_:forKey:), you can access NSDictionary values by their keys using subscripting.\nThere should typically be little need to subclass NSMutableDictionary. If you do need to customize behavior, it is often better to consider composition rather than subclassing.\nIn a subclass, you must override both of its primitive methods:\nsetObject(_:forKey:)\nremoveObject(forKey:)\nYou must also override the primitive methods of the NSDictionary class.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSDictionary"], "class_name": "NSMutableDictionary", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CustomReflectable", "CVarArg", "Equatable", "ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral", "Hashable", "Sequence"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
