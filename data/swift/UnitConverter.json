{"class_description": "For units that can be converted by a scale factor or linear equation, use the concrete subclass UnitConverterLinear.\nNSUnitConverter is an abstract class that is intended for subclassing. You can implement your own subclass of NSUnitConverter to convert between units according to any desired mapping function. For example, units may be converted using a logarithmic, exponential, or quantile scale.\nAll subclasses must fully implement the following methods:\nbaseUnitValue(fromValue:)\nvalue(fromBaseUnitValue:)\nAs stated above, most physical units can be converted using a linear equation with UnitConverterLinear. You should only create a custom subclass of NSUnitConverter for units that cannot be converted in this way. \n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "UnitConverter", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
