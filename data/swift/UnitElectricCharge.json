{"class_description": "You typically use instances of NSUnitElectricCharge to represent specific quantities of electric charge using the NSMeasurement class.\nElectric charge is a fundamental physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force within an electromagnetic field. The SI unit for electric charge is the coulomb (C), which is defined as the amount of charge carried by a current of one ampere in one second (1C = 1A \u00b7 1s). Charge is also commonly expressed in terms of ampere hours (Ah).\nThe NSUnitElectricCharge class defines its base unit as coulombs, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nCoefficient\nCoulombs\ncoulombs\nC\n1.0\nMegaampere Hours\nmegaampereHours\nMAh\n3.6e9\nKiloampere Hours\nkiloampereHours\nkAh\n3600000.0\nAmpere Hours\nampereHours\nAh\n3600.0\nMilliampere Hours\nmilliampereHours\nmAh\n3.6\nMicroampere Hours\nmicroampereHours\n\u00b5Ah\n0.0036\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Dimension"], "class_name": "UnitElectricCharge", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
