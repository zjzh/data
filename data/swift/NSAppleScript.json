{"class_description": "This class provides applications with the ability to\nload a script from a URL or from a text string\ncompile or execute a script or an individual Apple event\nobtain an NSAppleEventDescriptor containing the reply from an executed script or event\nobtain an attributed string for a compiled script, suitable for display in a script editor\nobtain various kinds of information about any errors that may occur\nImportant\nNSAppleScript provides the executeAppleEvent(_:error:) method so that you can send an Apple event to invoke a handler in a script. (In an AppleScript script, a handler is the equivalent of a function.) However, you cannot use this method to send Apple events to other applications.\nWhen you create an instance of NSAppleScript object, you can use a URL to specify a script that can be in either text or compiled form, or you can supply the script as a string. Should an error occur when compiling or executing the script, several of the methods return a dictionary containing error information. The keys for obtaining error information, such as errorMessage, are described in the Constants section.\nSee also NSAppleScript Additions Reference in the Application Kit framework, which defines a method that returns the syntax-highlighted source code for a script.\n", "Methods": [{"method_description": "Initializes a newly allocated script instance from the source identified by the passed URL.", "method_name": "init", "params": [{"param_type": "URL", "param_description": "A URL that locates a script, in either text or compiled form.", "param_name": ["contentsOf", "url"]}, {"param_type": "AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSDictionary>", "param_description": "On return, if an error occurs, a pointer to an error information dictionary.", "param_name": ["error", "errorInfo"]}], "class_name": "NSAppleScript", "method_declar": "init?(contentsOf url: URL, error errorInfo: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSDictionary?>?)", "return_value": {"return_description": ["The initialized script object, nil if an error occurs."], "return_name": [], "return_type": []}, "is_static": false}, {"method_description": "Initializes a newly allocated script instance from the source identified by the passed URL.", "method_name": "init", "params": [{"param_type": "URL", "param_description": "A URL that locates a script, in either text or compiled form.", "param_name": ["contentsOf", "url"]}, {"param_type": "AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSDictionary>", "param_description": "On return, if an error occurs, a pointer to an error information dictionary.", "param_name": ["error", "errorInfo"]}], "class_name": "NSAppleScript", "method_declar": "init?(contentsOf url: URL, error errorInfo: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSDictionary?>?)", "return_value": {"return_description": ["The initialized script object, nil if an error occurs."], "return_name": [], "return_type": []}, "is_static": false}], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSAppleScript", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
