{"class_description": "Delegates of NSURLConnection objects should implement either the NSURLConnectionDataDelegate or NSURLConnectionDownloadDelegate protocol in addition to the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol. Specifically:\nIf you are using NSURLConnection in conjunction with Newsstand Kit\u2019s download(with:) method, the delegate class should implement the NSURLConnectionDownloadDelegate protocol.\nOtherwise, the delegate class should implement the NSURLConnectionDataDelegate protocol.\nDelegates that wish to perform custom authentication handling should implement the connection(_:willSendRequestFor:) method, which is the preferred mechanism for responding to authentication challenges. (See URLAuthenticationChallenge for more information on authentication challenges.) If connection(_:willSendRequestFor:) is not implemented, the older, deprecated methods connection(_:canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace:), connection(_:didReceive:), and connection(_:didCancel:) are called instead.\nThe connection(_:didFailWithError:) method is called at most once if an error occurs during the loading of a resource. The connectionShouldUseCredentialStorage(_:) method is called once, just before the loading of a resource begins. \n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObjectProtocol"], "class_name": "NSURLConnectionDelegate", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": ["NSURLConnectionDataDelegate", "NSURLConnectionDownloadDelegate"]}
