{"class_description": "NSScriptWhoseTest is an abstract class whose sole method is isTrue(). Two concrete subclasses of NSScriptWhoseTest generate objects representing Boolean expressions comparing one object with another and objects representing multiple Boolean expressions connected by logical operators (OR, AND, NOT). These classes are, respectively, NSSpecifierTest and NSLogicalTest. In evaluating itself, an NSWhoseSpecifier invokes the isTrue() method of its \u201ctest\u201d object.\nYou shouldn\u2019t need to subclass NSScriptWhoseTest, and you should rarely need to subclass one of its subclasses.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSScriptWhoseTest", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
