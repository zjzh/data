{"class_description": "NSOrderedSet declares the programmatic interface for static sets of distinct objects. You establish a static set\u2019s entries when it\u2019s created, and thereafter the entries can\u2019t be modified. NSMutableOrderedSet, on the other hand, declares a programmatic interface for dynamic sets of distinct objects. A dynamic\u2014or mutable\u2014set allows the addition and deletion of entries at any time, automatically allocating memory as needed.\nYou can use ordered sets as an alternative to arrays when the order of elements is important and performance in testing whether an object is contained in the set is a consideration\u2014testing for membership of an array is slower than testing for membership of a set.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSOrderedSet", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "ExpressibleByArrayLiteral", "Hashable", "NSCopying", "NSFastEnumeration", "NSMutableCopying", "NSSecureCoding", "Sequence"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
