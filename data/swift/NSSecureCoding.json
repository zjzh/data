{"class_description": "Historically, many classes decoded instances of themselves like this:\nThis technique is potentially unsafe because by the time you can verify the class type, the object has already been constructed, and if this is part of a collection class, potentially inserted into an object graph.\nIn order to conform to NSSecureCoding:\nAn object that does not override init(coder:) can conform to NSSecureCoding without any changes (assuming that it is a subclass of another class that conforms).\nAn object that does override init(coder:) must decode any enclosed objects using the decodeObjectOfClass:forKey: method. For example:\nIn addition, the class must override the getter for its supportsSecureCoding property to return true.\nFor more information about how this relates to the NSXPC API, see Creating XPC Services in Daemons and Services Programming Guide.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSCoding"], "class_name": "NSSecureCoding", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": ["MPSHandle", "MPSImageAllocator", "MPSImageTransformProvider", "MPSNNPadding", "NFCTag"]}
