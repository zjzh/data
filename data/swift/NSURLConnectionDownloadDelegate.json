The methods in this protocol provide progress information about the download of a URL asset and, when downloading concludes, provide a file URL where the downloaded file can be accessed.\nIn addition to the methods described in this protocol, an NSURLConnection delegate should also implement the methods described in the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol.\nNote\nIf you are using NSURLConnection directly, your delegate class should instead implement the methods defined in the NSURLConnectionDataDelegate protocol.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSURLConnectionDelegate"], "class_name": "NSURLConnectionDownloadDelegate", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
