{"class_description": "An instance of NSCloseCommand closes the specified scriptable object or objects\u2014typically a document or window (and its associated document, if any). The command may optionally specify a location to save in and how to handle modified documents (by automatically saving changes, not saving them, or asking the user).\nNSCloseCommand is part of Cocoa\u2019s built-in scripting support. It works automatically to support the close command through key-value coding. Most applications don\u2019t need to subclass NSCloseCommand or call its methods.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSScriptCommand"], "class_name": "NSCloseCommand", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
