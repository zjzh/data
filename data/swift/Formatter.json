{"class_description": "The Foundation framework provides several concrete subclasses of Formatter, including ByteCountFormatter, DateFormatter, DateComponentsFormatter, DateIntervalFormatter, EnergyFormatter, LengthFormatter, MassFormatter, NumberFormatter, and PersonNameComponentsFormatter.\nNSFormatter is intended for subclassing. A custom formatter can restrict the input and enhance the display of data in novel ways. For example, you could have a custom formatter that ensures that serial numbers entered by a user conform to predefined formats. Before you decide to create a custom formatter, make sure that you cannot configure the public subclasses to satisfy your requirements.\nFor instructions on how to create your own custom formatter, see Creating a Custom Formatter.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "Formatter", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCoding", "NSCopying"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
