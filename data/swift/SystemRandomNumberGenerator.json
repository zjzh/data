For example, the two method calls in this example are equivalent:\nSystemRandomNumberGenerator is automatically seeded, is safe to use in multiple threads, and uses a cryptographically secure algorithm whenever possible.\nWhile the system generator is automatically seeded and thread-safe on every platform, the cryptographic quality of the stream of random data produced by the generator may vary. For more detail, see the documentation for the APIs used by each platform.\nApple platforms use arc4random_buf(3).\nLinux platforms use getrandom(2) when available; otherwise, they read from /dev/urandom.\n", "class_inherit_list": [], "package_name": "swift", "subclass_list": [], "class_type": "struct", "typealias": []}
