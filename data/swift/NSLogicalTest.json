{"class_description": "Instances of this class perform logical operations of AND, OR, and NOT on Boolean expressions represented by NSSpecifierTest objects. These operators are equivalent to \u201c&&\u201d, \u201c||\u201d, and \u201c!\u201d in the C language.\nFor AND and OR operations, an NSLogicalTest object is typically initialized with an array containing two or more NSSpecifierTest objects. isTrue()\u2014inherited from NSScriptWhoseTest\u2014evaluates the array in a manner appropriate to the logical operation. For NOT operations, an NSLogicalTest object is initialized with only one NSSpecifierTest object; it simply reverses the Boolean outcome of the isTrue() method.\nYou don\u2019t normally subclass NSLogicalTest.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSScriptWhoseTest"], "class_name": "NSLogicalTest", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
