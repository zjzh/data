{"class_description": "You typically use instances of NSUnitEnergy to represent specific quantities of energy using the NSMeasurement class.\nEnergy is a fundamental property of matter than can be transferred and converted into different forms, such as kinetic, electric, and thermal. The SI unit for energy is the joule (J), which is derived as the work of one meter of displacement in the direction of a force of one newton (1J = 1N \u2219 1m). It can also be derived as the work required to displace an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt (1J = 1C \u2219 1V), or the work required to produce one watt of power for one second (1J = 1W \u2219 1s). Energy is also commonly expressed in terms of the calorie (cal), or the energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere (1cal \u2261 4.184J).\nThe NSUnitEnergy class defines its base unit as joules, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nCoefficient\nKilojoules\nkilojoules\nkJ\n1000.0\nJoules\njoules\nJ\n1.0\nKilocalories\nkilocalories\nkCal\n4184.0\nCalories\ncalories\ncal\n4.184\nKilowatt Hours\nkilowattHours\nkWh\n3600000.0\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Dimension"], "class_name": "UnitEnergy", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
