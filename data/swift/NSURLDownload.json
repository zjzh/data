{"class_description": "The interface for NSURLDownload provides methods to initialize a download, set the destination path and cancel loading the request.\nThe delegate object assigned to each instance of this class should implement the methods defined by the NSURLDownloadDelegate protocol. These methods provide the delegate with the current status of in-progress asynchronous downloads and allow the delegate to customize the URL loading process. These delegate methods are called on the thread that started the asynchronous load operation for the associated NSURLDownload object.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSURLDownload", "typealias": [], "Vars": [{"var_description": "Returns whether the receiver deletes partially downloaded files when a download stops prematurely.", "var_type": "Bool", "is_static": false, "var_name": "deletesFileUponFailure"}, {"var_description": "Returns whether the receiver deletes partially downloaded files when a download stops prematurely.", "var_type": "Bool", "is_static": false, "var_name": "deletesFileUponFailure"}], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
