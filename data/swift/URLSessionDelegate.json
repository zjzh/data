{"class_description": "In addition to the methods defined in this protocol, most delegates should also implement some or all of the methods in the URLSessionTaskDelegate, URLSessionDataDelegate, and URLSessionDownloadDelegate protocols to handle task-level events. These include events like the beginning and end of individual tasks, and periodic progress updates from data or download tasks.\nNote\nYour URLSession object doesn\u2019t need to have a delegate. If no delegate is assigned, a system-provided delegate is used, and you must provide a completion callback to obtain the data.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObjectProtocol"], "class_name": "URLSessionDelegate", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": ["URLSessionTaskDelegate"]}
