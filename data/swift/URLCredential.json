{"class_description": "The URL Loading System supports password-based user credentials, certificate-based user credentials, and certificate-based server credentials.\nWhen you create a credential, you can specify it for a single request, persist it temporarily (until your app quits), or persist it permanently. Permanent persistence can be local persistence in the keychain, or synchronized persistence across the user's devices, based on their Apple ID.\nNote\nPermanent storage of credentials is only available for password-based credentials. TLS credentials are never stored permanently by URLCredentialStorage. In general, use for-session persistence for TLS credentials.\n\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "URLCredential", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
