{"class_description": "An instance of NSDeleteCommand deletes the specified scriptable object or objects (such as words, paragraphs, and so on).\nSuppose, for example, a user executes a script that sends the command delete the third rectangle in the first document to the Sketch sample application (located in /Developer/Examples/AppKit). Cocoa creates an NSDeleteCommand object to perform the operation. When the command is executed, it uses the key-value coding mechanism (by invoking removeValueAtIndex:fromPropertyWithKey:) to remove the specified object or objects from their container. See the description for removeValue(at:fromPropertyWithKey:) for related information.\nNSDeleteCommand is part of Cocoa\u2019s built-in scripting support. Most applications don\u2019t need to subclass NSDeleteCommand or call its methods.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSScriptCommand"], "class_name": "NSDeleteCommand", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
