{"class_description": "Each XPC service, launchd agent, or launchd daemon typically has at least one NSXPCListener object that listens for connections to a specified service name. Each listener must have a delegate that conforms to the NSXPCListenerDelegate protocol. When the listener receives a new connection request, it creates a new NSXPCConnection object, then asks the delegate to inspect, configure, and resume the connection object by calling the delegate's listener(_:shouldAcceptNewConnection:) method.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSXPCListener", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
