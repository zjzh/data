{"package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "An instance of NSMoveCommand moves the specified scriptable object or objects; for example, it may move words to a new location in a document or a file to a new directory.\nNSMoveCommand is part of Cocoa\u2019s built-in scripting support. It works automatically to support the move AppleScript command through key-value coding. Most applications don\u2019t need to subclass NSMoveCommand or invoke its methods. However, for circumstances where you might choose to subclass this command, see \"Modifying a Standard Command\" in Script Commands in Cocoa Scripting Guide.\nWhen an instance of NSMoveCommand is executed, it does not make copies of moved objects. It removes objects from the source container or containers, then inserts them into the destination container.\n", "class_type": "class", "typealias": [], "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "class_inherit_list": ["NSScriptCommand"], "Methods": [{"params": [{"param_name": ["receiversRef"], "param_type": "NSScriptObjectSpecifier", "param_description": "The receiver\u2019s object specifier."}], "class_name": "NSMoveCommand", "is_static": false, "return_value": {"return_name": [], "return_description": [], "return_type": []}, "method_name": "setReceiversSpecifier", "method_description": "Sets the receiver\u2019s object specifier.", "method_declar": "func setReceiversSpecifier(_ receiversRef: NSScriptObjectSpecifier?)"}], "class_name": "NSMoveCommand", "Vars": [{"var_description": "Returns a specifier for the object or objects to be moved.", "var_type": "NSScriptObjectSpecifier", "is_static": false, "var_name": "keySpecifier"}]}
