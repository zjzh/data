{"class_description": "You typically use instances of NSUnitElectricResistance to represent specific quantities of electric resistance using the NSMeasurement class.\nElectric resistance is the difficulty of passing an electric current through a conductor. The SI unit for electric resistance is the ohm (\u03a9), which is derived as the electric resistance that produces one ampere of current between two points in conductor with one volt of electric potential difference (1\u03a9 = 1V/1A).\nThe NSUnitElectricResistance class defines its base unit as ohms, and provides the following units, which are initialized using UnitConverterLinear converters with the specified coefficients:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nCoefficient\nMegaohms\nmegaohms\nM\u2126\n1000000.0\nKiloohms\nkiloohms\nk\u2126\n1000.0\nOhms\nohms\n\u2126\n1.0\nMilliohms\nmilliohms\nm\u2126\n0.001\nMicroohms\nmicroohms\n\u00b5\u2126\n0.000001\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Dimension"], "class_name": "UnitElectricResistance", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
