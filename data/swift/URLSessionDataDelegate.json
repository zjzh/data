{"class_description": "Your session delegate should also implement the methods in the URLSessionTaskDelegate protocol to handle task-level events that are common to all task types, and methods in the URLSessionDelegate protocol to handle session-level events.\nNote\nA URLSession object need not have a delegate. If no delegate is assigned, when you create tasks in that session, you must provide a completion handler block to obtain the data.\nCompletion handler blocks are primarily intended as an alternative to using a custom delegate. If you create a task using a method that takes a completion handler block, the delegate methods for response and data delivery are not called.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["URLSessionTaskDelegate"], "class_name": "URLSessionDataDelegate", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
