{"class_description": "An object conforming to the NSUserActivityDelegate protocol works with an NSUserActivity object, which encapsulates the state of a user activity in an application on a particular device and enables the same activity to be continued on another device. For example, a user browsing an article in Safari on a Mac can move to an iOS device where the same webpage automatically opens in Safari with the same scroll position.\nThe user activity delegate is responsible for updating the state of an activity and is also notified when an activity has been continued on another device. The user activity delegate is typically a top-level object in the app\u2014such as a window, view controller, or the app delegate\u2014that manages the activity\u2019s interaction with the app.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObjectProtocol"], "class_name": "NSUserActivityDelegate", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
