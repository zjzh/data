{"class_description": "The NSMutableCopying protocol declares a method for providing mutable copies of an object. Only classes that define an \u201cimmutable vs. mutable\u201d distinction should adopt this protocol. Classes that don\u2019t define such a distinction should adopt NSCopying instead.\nNSMutableCopying declares one method, mutableCopy(with:), but mutable copying is commonly invoked with the convenience method mutableCopy(). The mutableCopy() method is defined for all NSObjects and simply invokes mutableCopy(with:) with the default zone.\nIf a subclass inherits NSMutableCopying from its superclass and declares additional instance variables, the subclass has to override mutableCopy(with:) to properly handle its own instance variables, invoking the superclass\u2019s implementation first.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": [], "class_name": "NSMutableCopying", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
