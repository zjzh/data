{"class_description": "The NSMutableSet class declares the programmatic interface to a mutable, unordered collection of distinct objects.\nThe NSCountedSet class, which is a concrete subclass of NSMutableSet, supports mutable sets that can contain multiple instances of the same element. The NSSet class supports creating and managing immutable sets.\nNSMutableSet is \u201ctoll-free bridged\u201d with its Core Foundation counterpart, CFMutableSet. See Toll-Free Bridging for more information.\nThere should be little need of subclassing. If you need to customize behavior, it is often better to consider composition instead of subclassing.\nIn a subclass, you must override both of its primitive methods:\nadd(_:)\nremove(_:)\nYou must also override the primitive methods of the NSSet class.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSSet"], "class_name": "NSMutableSet", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CustomReflectable", "CVarArg", "Equatable", "ExpressibleByArrayLiteral", "Hashable", "Sequence"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
