{"class_description": "NSArchiver, a concrete subclass of NSCoder, provides a way to encode objects into an architecture-independent format that can be stored in a file. When you archive a graph of objects, the class information and instance variables for each object are written to the archive. The companion class NSUnarchiver decodes the data in an archive and creates a graph of objects equivalent to the original set.\nNSArchiver stores the archive data in a mutable data object (NSMutableData). After encoding the objects, you can have the NSArchiver object write this mutable data object immediately to a file, or you can retrieve the mutable data object for some other use.\nIn macOS 10.2 and later, NSArchiver and NSUnarchiver have been replaced by NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver respectively\u2014see Archives and Serializations Programming Guide. \n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSCoder"], "class_name": "NSArchiver", "typealias": [], "Vars": [{"var_description": "The name of an exception raised by NSArchiver if there are problems initializing or encoding.", "var_type": "NSExceptionName", "is_static": false, "var_name": "inconsistentArchiveException"}], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
