{"package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": [], "class_description": "You register an undo operation by calling one of the methods described in Registering Undo Operations. You specify the name of the object that\u2019s changing (or the owner of that object) and provide a closure, method, or invocation to revert its state.\nAfter you register an undo operation, you can call undo() on the undo manager to revert to the state of the last undo operation. When undoing an action, UndoManager saves the operations you reverted to so that you can call redo() automatically.\nUndoManager is typically used by apps with UI interactions. For example, UIKit implements undo and redo in its text view object, making it easy for you to undo and redo actions in objects along the responder chain. UndoManager also serves as a general-purpose state manager, which can be used to undo and redo many kinds of actions. For example, an interactive command-line utility could use this class to undo the last command run, or a networking library could undo a request by sending another request that invalidates the previous one.\n", "class_type": "class", "typealias": [], "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "Methods": [{"params": [{"param_name": ["withTarget", "target"], "param_type": "AnyObject", "param_description": "The target of the undo operation.The undo manager maintains an unowned reference to the target to prevent retain cycles."}, {"param_name": ["handler"], "param_type": "@escaping (TargetType) -> Void", "param_description": "A closure to be executed when an operation is undone.The closure takes a single argument, the target of the undo operation."}], "class_name": "UndoManager", "is_static": false, "return_value": {"return_name": [""], "return_description": [], "return_type": ["Void"]}, "method_name": "registerUndo", "method_description": "Registers the specified closure to implement a single undo operation that the target receives.", "method_declar": "func registerUndo<TargetType>(withTarget target: TargetType, handler: @escaping (TargetType) -> Void) where TargetType : AnyObject"}, {"params": [{"param_name": ["withTarget", "target"], "param_type": "Any", "param_description": "The target of the undo operation.
