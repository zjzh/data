An enumeration does not resolve symbolic links, or attempt to traverse symbolic links that point to directories.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSEnumerator"], "class_name": "FileManager.DirectoryEnumerator", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "Sequence"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
