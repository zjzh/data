The following example declares a Point type with x and y coordinates and a Boolean isFilled property.\nThe size, stride, and alignment of the Point type are accessible as static properties of MemoryLayout<Point>.\nAlways use a multiple of a type\u2019s stride instead of its size when allocating memory or accounting for the distance between instances in memory. This example allocates uninitialized raw memory with space for four instances of Point.\n", "class_inherit_list": [], "package_name": "swift", "subclass_list": [], "class_type": "enum", "typealias": []}
