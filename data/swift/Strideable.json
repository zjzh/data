{"class_description": "You can use a type that conforms to the Strideable protocol with the stride(from:to:by:) and stride(from:through:by:) functions. For example, you can use stride(from:to:by:) to iterate over an interval of floating-point values:\nThe last parameter of these functions is of the associated Stride type\u2014the type that represents the distance between any two instances of the Strideable type.\nTypes that have an integer Stride can be used as the boundaries of a countable range or as the lower bound of an iterable one-sided range. For example, you can iterate over a range of Int and use sequence and collection methods.\nTo add Strideable conformance to a custom type, choose a Stride type that can represent the distance between two instances and implement the advanced(by:) and distance(to:) methods. For example, this hypothetical Date type stores its value as the number of days before or after January 1, 2000:\nThe Stride type for Date is Int, inferred from the parameter and return types of advanced(by:) and distance(to:):\nThe Date type can now be used with the stride(from:to:by:) and stride(from:through:by:) functions and as the bounds of an iterable range.\nImportant\nThe Strideable protocol provides default implementations for the equal-to (==) and less-than (<) operators that depend on the Stride type\u2019s implementations. If a type conforming to Strideable is its own Stride type, it must provide concrete implementations of the two operators to avoid infinite recursion.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Comparable"], "class_name": "Strideable", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "swift", "subclass_list": ["BinaryInteger", "FloatingPoint"]}
