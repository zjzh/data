{"class_description": "You typically use instances of NSUnitFuelEfficiency to represent specific quantities of fuel efficiency using the NSMeasurement class.\nFuel efficiency corresponds to the thermal efficiency of a process that converts the chemical potential energy of a fuel into kinetic energy. Fuel efficiency can be expressed by SI derived units in terms of cubic meters per meter (m3/m), but is more commonly expressed in terms of liters per kilometer (L/km) and miles per gallon (mpg).\nThe NSUnitFuelEfficiency class defines its base unit as litersPer100Kilometers, and provides the following units:\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nLiters Per 100 Kilometers\nlitersPer100Kilometers\nL/100km\nMiles Per Gallon\nmilesPerGallon\nmpg\nMiles Per Imperial Gallon\nmilesPerImperialGallon\nmpg\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Dimension"], "class_name": "UnitFuelEfficiency", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
