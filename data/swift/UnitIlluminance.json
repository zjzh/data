{"class_description": "You typically use instances of NSUnitIlluminance to represent specific quantities of illuminance using the NSMeasurement class.\nIlluminance is the luminous flux incident on a surface. The SI unit for illuminance is the lux (lx), which is derived as one lumen per square meter (1lm / 1m2).\nThe NSUnitIlluminance class defines its base unit as lux.\nName\nMethod\nSymbol\nLux\nlux\nlx\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Dimension"], "class_name": "UnitIlluminance", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
