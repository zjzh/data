{"class_description": "The NSMutableCharacterSet class declares the programmatic interface to objects that manage a modifiable set of Unicode characters. You can add or remove characters from a mutable character set as numeric values in NSRange structures or as character values in strings, combine character sets by union or intersection, and invert a character set.\nMutable character sets are less efficient to use than immutable character sets. If you don\u2019t need to change a character set after creating it, create an immutable copy with copy and use that.\nNSMutableCharacterSet defines no primitive methods. Subclasses must implement all methods declared by this class in addition to the primitives of NSCharacterSet. They must also implement mutableCopy(with:).\nNSMutableCharacterSet is \u201ctoll-free bridged\u201d with its Core Foundation counterpart, CFMutableCharacterSet. See Toll-Free Bridging for more information.\nImportant\nThe Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the CharacterSet structure, which bridges to the NSMutableCharacterSet class and its immutable superclass, NSCharacterSet.  For more information about value types, see Working with Cocoa Frameworks in Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4.1).\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSCharacterSet"], "class_name": "NSMutableCharacterSet", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCopying", "NSMutableCopying", "NSSecureCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
