{"class_description": "You can access a string\u2019s view of Unicode scalar values by using its unicodeScalars property. Unicode scalar values are the 21-bit codes that are the basic unit of Unicode. Each scalar value is represented by a Unicode.Scalar instance and is equivalent to a UTF-32 code unit.\nSome characters that are visible in a string are made up of more than one Unicode scalar value. In that case, a string\u2019s unicodeScalars view contains more elements than the string itself.\nYou can convert a String.UnicodeScalarView instance back into a string using the String type\u2019s init(_:) initializer.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": [], "class_name": "String.UnicodeScalarView", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "struct", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
