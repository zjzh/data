Mirrors also provide a \u201cdisplay style\u201d property that suggests how this mirror might be rendered.\nPlaygrounds and the debugger use the Mirror type to display representations of values of any type. For example, when you pass an instance to the dump(_:_:_:_:) function, a mirror is used to render that instance\u2019s runtime contents.\nTo customize the mirror representation of a custom type, add conformance to the CustomReflectable protocol.\n", "class_inherit_list": [], "package_name": "swift", "subclass_list": [], "class_type": "struct", "typealias": []}
