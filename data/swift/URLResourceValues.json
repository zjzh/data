{"class_description": "URLs to file system resources support the properties defined below. Note that not all property values will exist for all file system URLs. For example, if a file is located on a volume that does not support creation dates, it is valid to request the creation date property, but the returned value will be nil, and no error will be generated.\nOnly the fields requested by the keys you pass into the URL function to receive this value will be populated. The others will return nil regardless of the underlying property on the file system.\nAs a convenience, volume resource values can be requested from any file system URL. The value returned will reflect the property value for the volume on which the resource is located.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": [], "class_name": "URLResourceValues", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "struct", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
