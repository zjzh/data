{"class_description": "The FileManagerDelegate protocol defines optional methods for managing operations involving the copying, moving, linking, or removal of files and directories. When you use an FileManager object to initiate a copy, move, link, or remove operation, the file manager asks its delegate whether the operation should begin at all and whether it should proceed when an error occurs.\nThe methods of this protocol accept either NSURL or NSString objects. The file manager always prefers methods that take an NSURL object over those that take an NSString object.\nYou should associate your delegate with a unique instance of the FileManager class, as opposed to the shared instance. \n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObjectProtocol"], "class_name": "FileManagerDelegate", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "protocol", "interface_list": [], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
