If the application is sandboxed, then the script must be in the FileManager.SearchPathDirectory.applicationScriptsDirectory folder.  A sandboxed application may read from, but not write to, this folder.\nIf you simply need to execute scripts without regard to input or output, use NSUserScriptTask, which can execute any of the specific types.
