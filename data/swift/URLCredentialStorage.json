{"class_description": "The shared cache stores and retrieves instances of URLCredential. You can store password-based credentials permanently, based on the URLCredential.Persistence they were created with. Certificate-based credentials are never stored permanently.\nThe URLCredentialStorage class is meant to be used as-is, but you can subclass it if you have specific needs, such as screening which credentials are stored.\nWhen overriding methods of this class, be aware that methods that take a task parameter are preferred to equivalent methods that do not. Therefore, you should override the task-based methods when subclassing, as follows:\nSetting credentials \u2014 Override set(_:for:task:) instead of or in addition to set(_:for:).\nGetting credentials \u2014 Override getCredentials(for:task:completionHandler:) instead of or in addition to credentials(for:).\nRemoving credentials \u2014 Override remove(_:for:options:task:) instead of or in addition to remove(_:for:options:) and remove(_:for:).\nSetting default credentials \u2014 Override setDefaultCredential(_:for:task:) instead of or in addition to setDefaultCredential(_:for:).\nGetting default credentials \u2014 Override getDefaultCredential(for:task:completionHandler:) instead of or in addition to defaultCredential(for:).\n\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "URLCredentialStorage", "typealias": [], "Vars": [{"var_description": "A notification posted when the set of stored credentials changes.", "var_type": "NSNotification.Name", "is_static": false, "var_name": "NSURLCredentialStorageChanged"}], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
