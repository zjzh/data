{"class_description": "A scriptable application provides scriptability information that describes the commands and objects scripters can use in scripts that target the application. An application\u2019s scripting information is collected automatically by an instance of NSScriptSuiteRegistry, which creates an NSScriptCommandDescription for each command it finds, caches these objects in memory, and installs a command handler for each command.\nA script command instance stores the name, class, argument types, and return type of a command. For example, commands in AppleScript\u2019s Core suite include clone, count, create, delete, exists, and move.\nThe public methods of NSScriptCommandDescription are used primarily by Cocoa\u2019s built-in scripting support in responding to Apple events that target the application. Although you can subclass the NSScriptCommandDescription class, it is unlikely that you would need to do so, or to create instances of it.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["NSObject"], "class_name": "NSScriptCommandDescription", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable", "NSCoding"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
