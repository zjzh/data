{"class_description": "NSMachPort is a subclass of Port that wraps a Mach port, the fundamental communication port in macOS. NSMachPort allows for local (on the same machine) communication only. A companion class, SocketPort, allows for both local and remote distributed object communication, but may be more expensive than NSMachPort for the local case.\nTo use NSMachPort effectively, you should be familiar with Mach ports, port access rights, and Mach messages. See the Mach\u00a0OS documentation for more information.\nNote\nNSMachPort conforms to the NSCoding protocol, but only supports coding by an NSPortCoder. Port and its subclasses do not support archiving.\n", "Methods": [], "class_inherit_list": ["Port"], "class_name": "NSMachPort", "typealias": [], "Vars": [], "class_type": "class", "interface_list": ["CVarArg", "Equatable", "Hashable"], "package_name": "foundation", "subclass_list": []}
